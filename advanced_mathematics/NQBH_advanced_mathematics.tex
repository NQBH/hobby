\section{\cite{Tao2007}. What Is Good Mathematics?}

\textbf{Abstract.} ``Some personal thoughts \& opinions on what ``good quality mathematics'' is \& whether one should try to define this term rigorously. As a case study, the story of Szemer\'edi's theorem is presented.''

\subsection{The Many Aspects of Mathematical Quality}
``We all agree that mathematicians should strive\footnote{\textbf{strive} [v] [intransitive] to try very hard to achieve something.} to produce good mathematics. \textit{But how does one define ``good mathematics'', \& should one even dare to try at all?} Let us 1st consider the former question. Almost immediately one realizes that there are many different types of mathematics which could be designated\footnote{\textbf{designate} [v] [often passive] \textbf{1.} to say officially that somebody\texttt{/}something has a particular character, name or purpose; to describe somebody\texttt{/}something in a particular way; \textbf{2.} to choose or name somebody\texttt{/}something for a particular job or position; \textbf{3.} (of a symbol) to identify or show something.} ``good''. E.g., ``good mathematics'' could refer (in no particular\footnote{\textbf{particular} [a] [only before noun] \textbf{1.} used to emphasize that you are referring to 1 individual person, thing or type of thing \& not others, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{specific}; \textbf{2.} greater than usual; special; \textbf{in particular} [idiom] \textbf{1.} especially or particularly; \textbf{2.} special, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{specific}; \textbf{of particular note} [idiom] especially interesting; [n] \textbf{1.} [countable, usually plural] a fact or detail, especially one that is officially written down; \textbf{2.} (\textbf{particulars}) [plural] written information \& details about a property, business, job, etc.} order) to
