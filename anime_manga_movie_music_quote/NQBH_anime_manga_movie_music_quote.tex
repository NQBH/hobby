    \textbf{Narrator.}
   	\begin{itemize}
   		\item ``In this world, is the destiny of mankind controlled by some transcendental entity or law? Is it like the hand of god hovering above? At least it is true that man has no control; even over his own will.''
   		\item ``It was much too big to be called a sword. Massive, thick, heavy, \& far too rough. Indeed, it was like a heap of raw iron.''
   		\item ``Dreams, ambition, love, hope; in this world, could the glories of a youthful heart be $\ldots$ forbidden?''
   		\item ``Dreams. Each man longs to pursue his dream. Each man is tortured by this dream, but the dream gives meaning to his life. Even if the dream ruins his life, man cannot allow himself to leave it behind. In this world, is man ever able to possess anything more solid, than a dream?''
   		\item ``In this world, there is a time that one is forever unable to retrieve. In pursuit for forgiveness one is destined to atone by living through agony \& letting time slip away. The sorrow in the furthest reaches of one's memory$\ldots$ The sorrow just beyond one's memory$\ldots$ Which is more heartbreaking?''
   		\item ``Providence may guide a man to meet 1 specific person, even if such guidance eventually leads him to darkness. Man simply cannot forsake the beauty of his own chosen path. When will man learn a way to control his soul?''
   		\item ``A man draws his sword in order to protect the small wound deep in his heart, it was inflicted in the days long past at the farthest reach of his memories, a man wields his sword in order to depart life with a smile$\ldots$''
   	\end{itemize}
    \textbf{Guts.}
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item ``Even if we painstakingly piece together something lost, it doesn't mean things will ever go back to how they were.''
    	\item Look around you carefully. Strain your eyes at the darkness around us$\ldots$ At the darkness around me. You said anywhere but here. This is where, here, at the border. Gathered by the winds. Those who have met their final destiny hanging between jealousy \& regret. Those who failed, swept together here. You say it doesn't matter where. If you follow me, this is where you'll go. This is your eden.''
    	\item ``If you're always worried about crushing the ants beneath you$\ldots$ you won't be able to walk.''
    	\item ``Do whatever you want now. But if you disturb me, I'll kill you.''
    	\item ``My place really was here. I was too foolish \& stubborn to notice. But, what I truly hoped for then was here$\ldots$ Why do I always realize it$\ldots$ When I've already lost it$\ldots$''
    	\item ``You have the strongest armor, because you are the weakest!''
    	\item ``When you meet your God, tell him to leave me alone.''
    	\item ``God shows himself on the ground. These are his miracles.''
    	\item ``I don't have time for miracles. They make me puke.''
    	\item ``He appeared right in front of me, \& he wasn't a demon$\ldots$ but what looked like a human. As if he'd been yanked from before into the present unchanged. I gazed at him \& for a second$\ldots$ \textbf{I forgot to kill him}.''
    	\item ``I'd rather fight for my life than live it.''
    	\item ``Couldn't you settle for a smile, \& a fond farewell?''
    	\item ``I don't want what another man can give me. If he grants me anything, then it's his to give \& not my own.''
    	\item ``In the end the winner is still the last man standing.''
    	\item ``I can't compare to you$\ldots$ Sure I can kill a hundred enemies but$\ldots$ \& not only you, but Griffith too. You both hold on to something, gambling with your very lives. It's amazing to me, I can't compare. I just kill for the sake of killing. Everyday, hundreds, thousands$\ldots$ There's nothing$\ldots$ honorable$\ldots$ about it.''
    	\item ``Looking from up here, it's as if each flame were a small dream, for each person. They look like a bonfire of dreams, don't they?$\ldots$ - But, there's not flame for me here. I'm just$\ldots$ a temporary visitor, taking comfort from the flame.''
    	\item ``Monsters shouldn't call themselves warriors, you self-centered bastard.''
    	\item ``Humans are weak$\ldots$ but we want to live$\ldots$ even if we're wounded$\ldots$ or tortured$\ldots$ we feel the pain$\ldots$''
    	\item ``A beast, a monster? Heh$\ldots$ Don't make me laugh. I$\ldots$ am me. \& nothing on earth. Can change me. No matter who chases me.''
    	\item ``So I guess you're like a mad dog that bit his master's hand. Not bad. I can't say that I don't like stuff like that. But you know$\ldots$ I hate to say this$\ldots$ But I don't have the time for that shit right now, like I would care about pissing contests between monsters. Go find someone else.''
    	\item ``Revenge$\ldots$ War$\ldots$ Maybe that's enough reason. I'm all alone, I think. For now. \& within me is the black berserker rage$\ldots$ \& only that$\ldots$ Will keep me on my feet. As I head toward you$\ldots$ Pressing on.''
    	\item ``Why do you shrink back from these sights? If you were in a place of worship, you'd call them angels. Talk to ``God.''''
    	\item ``People who perish in other's battles are worms$\ldots$ If one can't live their life the way they want, they might as well die.''
    	\item ``The reward for ambition too great$\ldots$ is self destruction.''
    	\item ``People bring the small flames of their wishes together$\ldots$ since they don't want to extinguish the small flame$\ldots$ they'll bring that small flame to a bigger fire. A big flame named Griffith. But you know$\ldots$ I didn't bring a flame with me. I think I just stopped by to warm myself by the bonfire.''
    	\item ``Throughout my life, the moments, \& people who have defined me$\ldots$ they have all been illuminated by sparks.;;
    	\item ``Where am I going? If I just collapsed back there I would be better off. If I were dead back there, there would be nothing. Now there's only bad.''
    \end{itemize}
	\textbf{Griffith.}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ``A friend would not just follow another's dream$\ldots$ a friend would find his own reason to live$\ldots$''
		\item ``A dream$\ldots$ It's something you do for yourself, not for others.''
		\item ``It is my perception that a true friend never relies on another's dream. A person with the potential to be my true friend must be able to find his reason for life without my help. \&, he would have to put his heart \& soul into protecting his dream. He would never hesitate to fight for his dream, even against me. For me, a true friend is one who stands equal on those terms.''
		\item ``A dream can make a man feel alive, or it can kill him instead. But to simply exist$\ldots$ just because one's been born is the sort of notion that I hate$\ldots$ I can't stand it.''
	\end{itemize}
	\textbf{Judeau.}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ``Whether it's good or bad, it's so unfortunate to wake up during a dream.''
		\item ``I realized that I could never be the best, so I decided to find the man that could \& serve by his side.''
		\item ``I'm a jack of all trades$\ldots$ a little better than most at everything, but I don't shine at anything.''
		\item ``It's okay to cry$\ldots$''
		\item ``You cry a lot when you're alone, don't you Casca?''
	\end{itemize}
	\textbf{Skull Knight.}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ``God gave them this destiny. This encounter.''
		\item ``What you want$\ldots$ may not be what she wants.''
		\item ``The world is as moonlight reflected on the water's surface. The moons light will not be extinguished. So long as the moon exists in the sky, moonlight will remain on the water$\ldots$ $\ldots$ \& this is a thing that already was. What will follow now is a shadow$\ldots$ No more than a shadow cast high above the earth$\ldots$ By light from a distant dying sun. We already subsist$\ldots$ Within the current of causality. We who exist beyond the physical are still merely shadows on the water. Maybe you aren't a shadow on the water$\ldots$ But instead, a fish that breaches water's surface.''

But there was 1 thing I wished for with all my heart. If I'm ever given a 2nd chance in life, I want to live for only myself. That is my sincere wish.''

For as long as the storm rages within him, he cannot find peace. Not in life, not in death. \& so he will do what he must, day in, day out. The pain is his vessel, desire his compass.

Language was invented for 1 reason, boys -- to woo women -- \&, in that endeavor, laziness will not do. It also won't do in your essays.'' --  N.H. Kleinbaum, Dead Poets Society
		\item ``We don't read \& write poetry because it's cute. We read \& write poetry because we are members of the human race. \& the human race is filled with passion. \& medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits \& necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for. To quote from Whitman, ``O me! O life! $\ldots$ of the questions of these recurring; of the endless trains of the faithless $\ldots$ of cities filled with the foolish; what good amid these, O me, O life?'' Answer.

		His hands reach out \& choke me, \& all the time he's mumbling.
		
		``Truth, truth.''

		\item ``Even if I thought I did a good job, if they said no, all the work I did would go down the drain.''

		\item ``Tonight, I have nothing to fear. I'll become a warrior.''
		\item ``When I wander around aimlessly, I can catch the briefest glimpse. `So that's what is in my head.' The feeling of being abandoned.''

		\item ``When I was a child, I was asked to hand in what we had prayed about at church. Looking at what my friends wrote, I thought, `Why would they pray for that? Grades, the school they want to get into, friends. They're seriously praying for that? To God? But it's God.' There was only 1 thing I was curious about. `What am I? Why am I here?'''
		\item ``I didn't exist before 1991 \& I won't exist in 50 years, but I feel like I existed before that \& will still exist after that. The feeling that I'll exist forever. I've been frustrated by that feeling \& I've never, in my heart, ever, felt settled.''
		\item ``I feel uneasy in bed, I feel uneasy around people. `Why can't I laugh happily like other people? Why am I sad all the time? Why am I always nervous? Why is everything so boring?''
		\item ``It feels like people are all scarecrows. They don't really know what they are. They're just acting as if they do.''
		\item ``People who say they live healthily \& happily maybe the people who decided to put all these questions behind them. People who have decided to lie \& say, `This is just how life is.' I'll never do that.''
		\item ``I don't care about where I'll go after I die. I want to see heaven while I'm alive.''
		\item ``It's bizarre when you see a thing somewhere it doesn't belong. A bird lying on the ground, a man hanging on a tree, even a dog on a farm.''
		\item ``I drink to feel high.'' -- Yeom Mi-Jeong
		
		``I drink to feel calm.'' -- Mr. Gu
		\item ``Why am I feeling sad? Why am I sad?''
		\item ``Then it's not food you want.''
		\item ``Out of the 24 hours in a day, I only feel okay for about a couple. \& it's not like I even feel good, I just feel okay. I just try to get through the rest.''
		\item ``I want liberation. I want to be liberated. I don't know where I'm trapped but I feel trapped. There's nothing in my life that relaxes me. I feel cramped \& stifled. I want to break free.''
		\item ``I'm not unhappy but I'm not happy either.''
		\item ``If you think about it, all the assholes in my life started with that same look in their eyes. Eyes that seemed to say, `You're not good enough.' It makes you feel so small. Like you're insignificant.''
		\item ``People are scared of thunder \& lightning but strangely, I find them calming.''
		\item ``It feels like I'm stuck but I don't know how to get out. That's probably why I hope everything ends all at once.''
		\item ``Everyone is on their way to their graves, so why is everyone so happy \& excited?''
		\item ``Sometimes, I think that people who are damaged are much more honest than those who live their lives happily.''
		\item ``I don't know where I'm stuck but I want to break free.''
		\item ``I wish I was genuinely happy \& be able to say things like `Yes, this is life,' `This is what life is all about.'''
		\item ``If we had lived in Seoul, would we have been any different?''
		\item ``If I imagine that I'm sitting here working next to you, even awful tasks like these turn into something beautiful. Work becomes bearable.''
		\item ``Rather than going through exhausting, difficult times without you, isn't it more admirable that I'm finding strength thinking of you?''
		\item ``No matter where I live, I think I would have been the same. I'd be living the same mundane life \& no on would ever be interested in me. I felt like if I lived like this for too long, I'd shrivel up \& die.''
		\item ``People are so good with words.''
		\item ``I want all of us to be happy. As bright \& cheery as a sunny day. Without so much as a crease in our hearts.''
		\item ``Maybe it's just me who's worth 20 points.''
		\item ``I'm exhausted. I don't know when it all started to go wrong, but I'm exhausted.''

	\begin{itemize}
		\item ``As for me, once the doubt had entered my mind, what other choice did it leave me but to search for the truth, in all fields?'' -- \cite{Tartar2006}
		\item ``To an uninformed observer, it may seem that there is more interest in the Navier--Stokes equation nowadays, but many who claim to be interested show such a lack of knowledge about continuum mechanics that one may wonder about such a superficial attraction. \textit{Could one of the Clay Millennium Prizes be the reason behind this renewed interest?} Reading the text of the conjectures to be solved for winning that particular prize leaves the impression that the subject was not chosen by people interested in continuum mechanics, as the selected questions have almost no physical content.'' -- \cite[Preface, p. vii]{Tartar2006}		
		\item ``One should learn to distinguish between a mathematical property of an equation and a conjecture that some property holds which one guesses from the belief that the equation corresponds to a physical problem. One should learn about which defects are already known concerning how a mathematical model describes physical reality, but one should not forget that a mathematical model which is considered obsolete from the physical point of view may still be useful for mathematical reasons. I often wonder why so many forget to mention the defects of the models that they study.'' -- \cite[Preface, p. vii]{Tartar2006}		
		\item ``If one had used the word ``turbulence'' to make the donator believe that he would be giving one million dollars away for an important realistic problem in continuum mechanics, why has attention been restricted to unrealistic domains without boundary (the whole space $\mathbb{R}^3$, or a torus for periodic solutions), as if one did not know that vorticity is created at the boundary of the domain? The problems seem to have been chosen in the hope that they will be solved by specialists of harmonic analysis, and it has given the occasion to some of these specialists to help others in showing the techniques that they use, as in a recent book by \cite{Lemarie-Rieusset2016}'' -- \cite[Preface, p. viii]{Tartar2006}		
		\item ``Being a mathematician interested in science, and having learnt more than most mathematicians about various aspects of mechanics and physics, one reason for teaching various courses and writing lecture notes is to help isolated researchers to learn about some aspects unknown to most mathematicians whom they could meet, or read. A consequence of this choice is then to make researchers aware that some who claim to work on problems of continuum mechanics or physics have forgotten to point out known defects of the models that they use.'' -- \cite[Preface, pp. viii--ix]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``Of course, I also suffer from the same disease of not having learnt enough\footnote{NQBH: i.e., imposter syndrome obviously.}, but my hope is that by explaining what I have already understood and by showing how to analyze and criticize classical models, many will acquire my understanding and a few will go much further than I have on the path of discovery.'' -- \cite[Preface, p. ix]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``I once heard my advisor, Jacques-Louis LIONS, mention that once the detailed plan of a book is made, the book is almost written, and he was certainly speaking of experience as he had already written a few books at the time. He gave me the impression that he could write directly a very reasonable text, which he gave to a secretary for typing; maybe he then gave chapters to one of his students, as he did with me for one of his books, and very few technical details had to be fixed. His philosophy seemed to be that there is no need to spend too much time polishing the text or finding the best possible statement, as the goal is to take many readers to the front of research, or to be more precise to one front of research, because in the beginning he changed topics every two or three years.'' -- \cite[Preface, p. ix]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``As for myself, I have not yet written a book, and the main reason is that I am quite unable to write in advance a precise plan of what I am going to talk about, and I have never been very good at writing even in my mother tongue (French). When I write, I need to read again and again what I have already written until I find the text acceptable (and that notion of acceptability evolves with time and I am horrified by my style of twenty years ago), so this way of writing is quite inefficient, and makes writing a book prohibitively long. One solution would be not to write books, and when I go to a library I am amazed by the number of books which have been written on so many subjects, and which I have not read, because I never read much. \textit{Why then should I add a new book?} However, I am even more amazed by the number of books which are not in the library, and although I have access to a good inter-library loan service myself, I became concerned with how difficult it is for isolated students to have access to scientific knowledge (and I do consider mathematics as part of science, of course).'' -- \cite[Preface, p. ix]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``It is clear that fewer and fewer students in industrialized countries are interested in studying mathematics, for various reasons, and as a consequence more and more mathematicians are likely to come from developing countries. It will therefore be of utmost importance that developing countries should not simply become a reservoir of good students that industrialized countries would draw upon, but that these countries develop a sufficiently strong scientific environment for the benefit of their own economy and people, so that only a small proportion of the new trained generations of scientists would become interested in going to work abroad.'' -- \cite[Preface, p. ix]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``I have seen the process of decolonization at work in the early 1960s, and I have witnessed the consequences of too hasty a transition, which was not to the benefit of the former colonies, and certainly the creation of a scientific tradition is not something that can be done very fast. I see the development of mathematics as a good way to start building a scientific infrastructure, and inside mathematics the fields that I have studied should play an important role, where mathematics interacts with continuum mechanics and physics.'' -- \cite[Preface, pp. ix--x]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``I decided at that time to add some information that one rarely finds in courses of mathematics, something about the people who have participated in the creation of the knowledge related to the subject of the course. I had the privilege to study in Paris in the late 1960s, to have great teachers like Laurent SCHWARTZ and Jacques-Louis LIONS, and to have met many famous mathematicians. This has given me a different view of mathematics than the one that comes from reading books and articles, which I find too dry, and I have tried to give a little more life to my story by telling something about the actors; for those mathematicians whom I have met, I have used their first names in the text, and I have tried to give some simple biographical data for all people quoted in the text, in order to situate them, both in time and in space.'' -- \cite[Preface, p. x]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``I observe that there have been efficient schools in some areas of mathematics at some places and at some moments in time, and when I was a student in Paris in the late 1960s, Jacques-Louis LIONS had mentioned that Moscow was the only other place comparable to Paris for its concentration of mathematicians. Although the conditions might be less favorable outside important centers, I want to think that a lot of good work could be done elsewhere, and my desire is that my lecture notes may help isolated researchers participate more in the advance of scientific knowledge. A few years ago, an Italian friend, GianPietro DEL PIERO, told me that he had taught for a few months in Somalia, and he mentioned that one student had explained to him that he should not be upset if some of the students fell asleep during his lectures, because the reason was not their lack of interest in the course, but the fact that sometimes they had eaten nothing for a few days. It was by thinking about these courageous students who, despite the enormous difficulties that they encounter in their everyday life, are trying to acquire some precious knowledge about mathematics, that I devised my plan to write lecture notes and make them available to all, wishing that they could arrive freely to isolated students and researchers, working in much more difficult conditions than those having access to a good library, or in contact with good teachers. I hope that publishing this revised version will have the effect that it will reach many libraries scattered around the world, where isolated researchers have access.'' -- \cite[Preface, p. xi]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``I hope that my lack of organizational skills will not bother the readers too much. I consider teaching courses like leading groups of newcomers into countries which are often unknown to them, but not unknown to me, as I have often wandered around; some members of a group who have already read about the region or have been in other expeditions with guides more organized than me might feel disoriented by my choice of places to visit, and indeed I may have forgotten to show a few interesting places, but my goal is to familiarize the readers with the subject and encourage them to acquire an open and scientific point of view, and not to write a definitive account of the subject.'' -- \cite[Preface, p. xii]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``There are results which are repeated, but it is inevitable in a real course that one should often recall results which have already been mentioned. There are also results which are mentioned without proof, and sometimes they are proven later but sometimes they are not, and if no references are given, one should remember that I have been trained as a mathematician, and that my statements without proofs have indeed been proven in a mathematical sense, because if they had not I would have called them conjectures instead;\footnote{Some people like to talk of pure mathematics versus applied mathematics, but I do not think that such a distinction is accurate, as I mentioned in the introduction of an article for a conference at \'Ecole Polytechnique (Palaiseau, France) in the fall of 1983, but because that introduction was cut by political censors, it is worth repeating that for what concerns different parts of mathematics there are those which I know, those which I do not know well but think that they could be useful to me, and those which I do not know well but do not see how they could be useful to me, and all this evolves with time, so I finally wonder if it is reasonable to classify mathematics as being pure or applied. I consider myself as an ``applied'' mathematician, although I give it a French meaning (a mathematician interested in other fields of science), opposed to a British meaning (a specialist of continuum mechanics, allowed to use an incomplete mathematical proof without having to call the result a conjecture), and in French universities, applied mathematicians in the British style are found in departments of m\'ecanique. Probably for the reason of funding, which strangely enough is given more easily to people who pretend to do applied research, some who have studied to become mathematicians practice the art of using words which make naive people wrongly believe that they know continuum mechanics or physics, and I find this attitude potentially dangerous for the university system.} however, I am also human and my memory is not perfect and I may have made mistakes. I think that the right attitude in mathematics is to be able to explain all the statements that one makes, but in a course one has to assume that the reader already has some basic knowledge of mathematics, and some proofs of a more elementary nature are omitted. Here and there I mention a result that I have heard of, but for which I never read a proof or did not make up my own proof, and I usually say so. If many proofs are mine it does not necessarily mean that I was the first to prove the corresponding result, but that I am not aware of a prior proof, maybe because I never read much. Actually, my advisor mentioned to me that it is useful to read only the statement of a theorem and one should read the proof only if one cannot supply one.'' -- \cite[Preface, pp. xii--xiii]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``My personal mathematical training has been in functional analysis and PDEs, starting at \'Ecole Polytechnique, Paris, France, where I had two great teachers, Laurent SCHWARTZ and Jacques-Louis LIONS. Having studied there in order to become an engineer, but having had to change my orientation once I had been told that such a career required administrative skills (which I lack completely), I opted for doing research in mathematics with an interest in other sciences and I asked Jacques-Louis LIONS to be my advisor, and it was normal that once I had been taught enough on the mathematical side, I would apply my improved understanding to investigating questions of continuum mechanics and physics which I had heard about as a student, and to developing the new mathematical tools which are necessary for that.'' -- \cite[Preface, p. xiii]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``In my lectures I also try to teach mathematicians about the defects of the models used, but I want to apologize for some of the words which I use, which may have offended some. I have a great admiration for the achievements of physicists and engineers\footnote{I am not mentioning biologists and chemists because biology was not part of my studies, and although I have learnt some chemistry, I only hope to understand it in a better way once my program for understanding continuum mechanics and physics has progressed enough.} during the last century, and a lot of the improvements in our lives result from their understanding, which is so different than the type of understanding that mathematicians are trained to achieve. If I write that something that they say does not make any sense, it is not a criticism towards physicists or engineers, who are following the rules of their profession, but it is a challenge to my fellow mathematicians that there is something there that mathematicians ought to clarify.'' -- \cite[Preface, p. xiii]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``Most problems are much too academic from the point of view of continuum mechanics, because the model used by Jean LERAY is too crude to be meaningful, and the difficulties of the open questions are merely of a technical mathematical nature. Also, Jean LERAY unfortunately called turbulent the weak solutions that he was seeking, and it must be stressed that turbulence is certainly not about regularity or lack of regularity of solutions, nor about letting time go to infinity either.'' -- \cite[Introduction, p. xv]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``It seems to have become my trade mark among mathematicians, that I do not want to lie about the usefulness of models when some of their defects have already been pointed out. This is obviously the way that any scientist is supposed to behave, but in explaining why I have found myself so isolated and stubborn in maintaining that behavior, I have often invoked a question of religious training.'' -- \cite[Introduction, p. xvi]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``I am not good at following plans.'' -- \cite[Introduction, p. xvi]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``I opted for describing the general techniques for nonlinear partial differential equations that I had developed, \textit{homogenization, compensated compactness} and \textit{H-measures}; there are obviously many important situations where they should be useful, and I found it more important to teach them than to analyze in detail some particular models for which I do not feel yet how good they are (which means that I suspect them to be quite wrong). Regularly, I was trying to explain why what I was teaching had some connection with questions about \textit{fluids}.'' -- \cite[Introduction, pp. xvi--xvii]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``It goes with my philosophy to \textit{explain the origin of mathematical ideas} when I know about them, and as my ideas are often badly attributed, I like to mention \textit{why and when I had introduced an idea}.'' -- \cite[Introduction, p. xvii]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``I have also tried to \textit{encourage mathematicians to learn more about continuum mechanics and physics}, listening to the specialists and then trying to put these ideas into a sound mathematical framework.'' -- \cite[Introduction, p. xvii]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``The framework of functional analysis is not just a change of language, because it is crucial for understanding the point of view that I developed in the 1970s for relating what happens at a macroscopic level from the description at a microscopic\texttt{/}mesoscopic level, using convergences of weak type (and not just weak convergences), which is quite a different idea than the game of using ensemble averages, which destroys the physical meaning of the problems considered.]'' -- \cite[Introduction, p. xvii]{Tartar2006}

\subsection{Game}
Actually, I only play 1 game, DotA 2, which is good for training strategies \& concentration.

\subsubsection{DotA 2}
I have used DotA 2 as an ``intermediate break'': When I feel tired with words \& research, I will take some notes \& pause my work, I play some DotA 2 matches until I lose (if I win, I continue to find another \textsc{mmr} match). The reason is simple: The toxicity of DotA 2 community \& stupidity of some DotA 2 players, especially in some matches I have done all my best to carry them, make me intellectually bored with gaming \& thus motivate me to get back to my research work. The boring--stimulating loop\texttt{/}cycle will continue until the end of the day everyday.
