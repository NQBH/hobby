\section{Anime, Manga, {\it\&} Manhwa}
I have a habit to watch animes with the speed 1.5x, 1.75x, or 2x, not at the normal speed so that I can have more free time \& watch much more animes \& others also.

    {\bf BoJack Horseman.}
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item ``He's so stupid he doesn't realize how miserable he should be. I envy that.''
    	\item ``Ow, crap. I hate this. Running is terrible. Everything is the worst.''
    	\item ``You know sometimes I feel like I was born with a leak, \& any goodness I started with just slowly spilled out of me, \& now it's all gone. And I'll never get it back in me. It's too late. ... Life is a series of closing doors, isn't it?''
    	\item``You are a horrible person, \& you not understanding that you're a horrible person, doesn't make you less of a horrible person.''
    	\item ``I'm responsible for my own happiness? I can't even be responsible for my own breakfast!''
    	\item ``You sleep on my couch \& you don't pay rent. I've had tapeworms that are less parasitic. I don't even remember why I let you stay with me in the 1st place.''
    	\item ``Man, I really regret buying those muffins \& then eating them all on the drive home.''
    	\item ``I feel like my life is just a series of unrelated wacky adventures''
    	\item ``I don't understand how people... live. It's amazing to me that people wake up every morning \& say: `Yeah, another day, let's do it.' How do people do it? I don't know how.''
    	\item ``Look, for a lot of people, life is just one long hard kick in the urethra.''
    	\item ``Same thing that always happens. You didn't know me \& then you fell in love with me. And now you know me.''
    	\item ``Now if you excuse me, I need to go take a shower so I can't tell if I'm crying or not.''
    	\item ``I spend a lot of time with the real me \& believe me, nobody's gonna love that guy.''
    	\item ``Yeah, I ate them all in one sitting because I have no self-control \& I hate myself.''
    	\item ``nothing on the outside, nothing on the inside'' as he runs his hand over the oven
    	\item ``Settle. Because otherwise you're just gonna get older \& harder, \& more alone. And you're gonna do everything you can to fill that hole, with friends, \& your career, \& meaningless sex, but the hole doesn't get filled. One day, you're gonna look around \& you're going to realize that everybody loves you, but nobody likes you. And that is the loneliest feeling in the world.''
    	\item ``I want to feel good about myself. The way you do. And I don't know how. I don't know if I can.''
    	\item ``Fool me once, shame on you. But teach a man to fool me \& I'll be fooled for the rest of my life'' 
    	\item ``Dead on the inside, dead on the outside.''
    	\item ``I have half a mind...''
    	\item ``I can't say no to people because I want everyone to like me.''
    	\item ``It's made up by Steven Spielberg to sell movie tickets. It's like the happiness or the Munich Olympics, it doesn't exist in the real world. The only thing to do now is just to keep living forward.''
    	\item ``We're just two lonely people trying to hate ourselves a little less.''
    	\item ``your girlfriend has a stripper name''
    	\item ``Kelsey, in this terrifying world, all we have are the connections that we make. I'm sorry I got you fired, I'm sorry I never called you after.''
    	\item ``Being a movie star is the hardest job, \& we get no recognition!''
    	\item ``Todd, your good-hearted naivety has once again conspired with outrageous happenstance to completely dick me over!''
    	\item ``Why 12 steps? Nobody wants to do 12 of anything. Did you see `12 Years A Slave' \& think `that's a short number of years to be a slave?'''
    	\item ``When your father dies, you ask yourself a lot of questions, like `Wait, did you say he died in a duel?' \& `Who dies in a duel?'''
    	\item ``Is it possible that this whole time, I've been an amazing feminist hero \& nobody knew it?''
    	\item ``Diane, I am a famous -- everyone gives me everything I want all the time. It is an existential curse, but a huge day-to-day convenience.''
    	\item ``You've got a nice set of pipes. You're like a Josh Groban who doesn't also think he's funny.''
    	\item ``I want to do things with you. Fully clothed, sober, in daylight hours.''
    	\item ``How can I put this... imagine if the Holocaust happened every four years like the Olympics. I would rather THAT happen than your rock opera.''
    	\item ``Goddammit, Honeydew? Jesus, why does Cantaloupe think every time it gets invited to a party it can bring along its dumb friend Honeydew? You don't get a plus one Cantaloupe.''
    	\item ``There's that old saying: Liquor before beer, never fear, don't do heroin.''
    	\item ``Why put the skip ad button so late? I'm not skipping now. I'm invested.''
    	\item ``I drove, but I moved my arm a bunch so the Fitbit counted the miles.''
    	\item ``That was, \& I don't say this lightly, worse than 100 September 11ths.''
    	\item ```Here's the thing about most long distance plans.' I hate that. `Here's the thing.' It's so stupid! Just say the thing! You don't need to introduce the concept that there's going to be a thing.''
    	\item ``Todd! Get in the car. It is time to get serious about autoerotic asphyxiation.''
    	\item ``Also, are you wearing comfortable shoes? Because I feel like that was a long road to walk to get to that punchline.''
    	\item ``I'm sorry I accused you of murder, American TV legend Henry Winkler.''
    	\item ``Slap my salami, the guy's a commie.''
    	\item ``I told you, that's not what was happening that time! I was masturbating to what the picture represented! And you came in at the worst possible time!''
    	\item ```Neigh way, Jose!' I improvised that line. I mean, it was scripted, but I gave it the ol' BoJack spin.''
    	\item ``Well, that was another in a long series of regrettable life choices.''
    	\item ``It's so sad that when you see someone as they really are, it ruins them.''
    	\item ``I've had a lot of what I thought were rock bottoms, only to discover another, rockier bottom underneath.''
    	\item ``Just pretend you are happy, \& eventually you'll forget you're pretending.''
    	\item ``I have poison inside me, \& I destroy everything I touch.''
    	\item ``The only thing to do now is just to keep living forward.''
    	\item ``My darling mother gave the eulogy. My entire life, I never heard her say a kind word to OR about my father, but at his funeral, she said, ``My husband is dead, \& everything is worse now.''
    	\item ``I'm gonna say ``Hello. I am BoJack Horseman. Obviously, you know who I am, because I'm very famous, \& also because we called ahead. And I am here because ... I need help.''
    	\item ``I don't hate the troops, I just hate one specific troop. I don't even hate him, I just think he's wrong about the muffins.''
    	\item ``All I learned about being good, I learned from TV. And in TV, flawed characters are constantly showing people they care with these surprising grand gestures. And I think that part of me still believes that's what love is.''
    	\item ``I told you, that's not what was happening that time. I was masturbating to what the picture represented! You walked in at the worst possible moment.''
    	\item ``You turn yourself around. That's what it's all about.''
    	\item ``I don't cry in front of other people.''
    	\item ``But in real life, the big gesture isn't enough. You need to be consistent, you need to be dependably good. You need to do it every day, which is so ... hard.''
    	\item ``What more do you want?! What else could the Universe possibly owe you?''
    \end{itemize}
    {\bf Diane Nguyen.}
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item ``It's not about being happy, that is the thing. I'm just trying to get through each day. I can't keep asking myself `Am I happy?' It just makes me more miserable. I don't know If I believe in it, real lasting happiness, All those perky, well-adjusted people you see in movies \& TV shows ? I don't think they exist.''
    	\item ``Idea for a new app: an undo button that can undo long amounts of time. Three months. A year. A life.''
    	\item ``Even if no one appreciates you, it's important that you don't stop being good.''
    	\item ``When I was a kid, I used to watch you on TV, \& you know I didn't have the best family. Things weren't that great for me. But, for half an hour, every week, I got to watch this show about four people who had nobody, who came together \& became a family, \& for half an hour, every week, I had a home, \& it helped me survive.''
    	\item ``Well, that's the problem with life, right? Either you know that you want \& then you don't get what you want, or you get what you want, \& then you don't know what you want.''
    	\item ``Most people don't even get to do the brady bunch version of the thing they want to do with their lives.''
    	\item ``You're responsible for your own happiness, you know?''
    	\item ``You learn that you can survive being alone.''
    	\item ``Sometimes life's a bitch \& you keep living.''
    	\item ``There are people in your life that help you become the person you end up being, \& you can be grateful for them, even if they were never meant to be in your life forever.''
    	\item ``Every happy ending has the day after the happy ending.''
    	\item ``There's no deep down, I believe that all we are is what we do.''
    	\item ``There's no such thing as ``bad guys'' or ``good guys''. We're all just... guys, who do good stuff sometimes \& bad stuff sometimes. And all we can do is try to do less bad stuff \& more good stuff, but you're never going to be good because you're not bad.''
    \end{enumerate}
    {\bf Todd Chavez.}
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item ``Things don't become traditions because they're good, BoJack, they become good because they're traditions.''
    	\item ``You can't keep doing shitty things, \& then feel bad about yourself like that makes it okay! You need to be better!''
    	\item ``You are all the things that are wrong with you.''
    \end{enumerate}
    {\bf Princess Carolyn.}
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item ``Oh fish. Of course! Why would you ever make things easy for me when instead you could make things incredibly difficult. Laura! Clear our my schedule! I have to push a boulder up a hill \& then have it roll over me time \& time again with no regard for my well-being!''
    	\item ``That woman can knock a drink back like a Kennedy at a wake for another Kennedy, but I'll be damned if she doesn't get shit done!''
    	\item ``BoJack, I'm gonna level with you, honey. This whole you-hating-the-troops thing is not great.''
    	\item ``Because my life is a mess right now \& I compulsively take care of other people.''
    	\item ``I got into this business because I love stories. They comfort us, they inspire us, they create a context for how we experience the world. But also, you have to be careful, because if you spend a lot of time with stories, you start to believe that life is just stories, \& it's not. Life is life, \& that's so sad because there's so little time \& ... what are we doing with it?''
    	\item ``So, are you available for Tuesday, or are you gonna be too busy masturbating to old pictures of yourself.``
    	\item ``Stop pissing off the orphans. A lot of them grow up to be serial killers.''
    \end{enumerate}
    {\bf Mr. Peanutbutter.}
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item ``Sweetie, you know I support you, whatever you want to do, but you're not gonna find what you're looking for in these awful made-up places. The universe is a cruel, uncaring void. The key to being happy isn't the search for meaning; it's just to keep yourself busy with unimportant nonsense, \& eventually, you'll be dead.''
    	\item ``Everybody deserves to be loved''
    	\item ``Crack an egg on your head. Let the yolk drip down.''
    	\item ``All I ever wanted was to be your friend ... \& you treat me like a big joke. You think I don't notice? Why don't you like me?''
    	\item ``I told you I don't know where it is. Don't put things in my butt if you want them back.''
    \end{enumerate}
    {\bf Herb Kazzaz.}
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item ``You know what your problem is? You want to think of yourself as the good guy. Well, I know you better than anyone, \& I can tell you that you're not. In fact, you'd probably sleep a lot better at night if you just admitted to yourself that you're a selfish goddamn coward who just takes whatever he wants \& doesn't give a shit about who he hurts. That's you. That's BoJack Horseman.''
    	\item ``There is no other side.''
    \end{enumerate}
    {\bf Beatrice Horseman.}
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item ``I'm punishing you for being alive.''
    	\item ``I just wanted to tell you that I know. I know you want to be happy, but you won't be... \& I'm sorry.''
    	
    	BoJack: ``... What?''
    	
    	``It's not just you, you know. Your father \& I, we, well... you come by it honestly, the ugliness inside you. You were born broken, that's your birthright. And now you can fill your life with projects your books \& your movies \& your little girlfriends but... that won't make you whole. You're BoJack Horseman. There's no cure for that.''
    	\item ``Don't throw your dreams away for this child. Don't let that man poison your life the way he did mine. You are going to finish your schooling \& become a nurse. You'll meet a man, a good man, \& you'll have a family, but please, believe me, you don't want this. Please, Henrietta, you have to believe me. Please ... don't do what I did.''
    	\item ``Henrietta, don't use a foreign language in front of the child, she'll get ideas!''
    \end{enumerate}
    {\bf Henry Winkler.}
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item ``There is no shame in dying for nothing. That's why most people die.''
    \end{enumerate}
    {\bf Hollyhock.}
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item ``That voice, the one that tells you you're stupid, worthless, \& ugly... it goes away right? It's just a dumb teenage girl thing, but... then it goes away?'', ``Yeah''
    \end{enumerate}
    {\bf Secretariat.}
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item ``BoJack, when I was your age, I got sad. A lot. I didn't come from such a great home, but one day, I started running, \& that seemed to make sense, so then I just kept running. BoJack, when you get sad you run, straight ahead \& you keep running forward no matter what there are people in your life that who are going to try to hold you back , slow you down , but you don't let them. Don't you ever stop running, don't ever look behind you there is nothing for you behind you. All that exists is whats ahead.'' 
    \end{enumerate}
    {\bf Wanda Pierce.}
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item ``When you look at someone through rose-colored glasses, all the red flags just look like flags.''
    \end{enumerate}
    {\bf Amanda Hannity.}
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item ''When we know what we know about a monster like that \& we still put him on TV every week, we're teaching a generation of young boys \& girls that a man's reputation is more important than the lives of the women he's ruined.''
    \end{enumerate}
    {\bf Fuzzy Whiskers.}
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item ``I don't know what to tell you. I'm happy for the 1st time in my life \& I'm not gonna feel bad about it. It takes a long time to realise how truly miserable you are \& even longer to see it doesn't have to be that way. Only after you give up everything can you begin to find a way to be happy.''
    \end{enumerate}
    {\bf Sextina Aquafina.}
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item ``I think about my child's heartbeat \& oh, it makes me weep. I hope \& pray to God my little fetus has a soul. Because I want it to feel pain when I eject it from my hole.''
    \end{enumerate}
    {\bf Miscellaneous.}
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item ``There has been another mass shooting. I am totally unqualified to cover a news story this important, but as a straight white male, I will plow forward with confidence \& assume I'm doing fine!''
    	\item ``It gets easier. Every day it gets a little easier. But you gotta do it every day -- that's the hard part. But it does get easier''
    	\item ``When you do bad things, you have something you can point to when people eventually leave you. It's not you, you tell yourself, it's that bad thing you did. Do you often keep people at arm's length? Are you afraid of being known \& knowing others?''
    	\item ``He's probably just razzin' ya. But he's a good dog. All bark, no bite. Oh, sorry! That's a labrador expression. I guess in human terms it would be: he's all talk, no shooting you with an assault rifle.''
    	\item ``Do you ever get the feeling that to know you more is to love you less?''
    	\item ``It doesn't matter where you are, it's who you are, that's not gonna change whether you're in California or Maine or New Mexico. You know, you can't escape you.''

    {\sc Hiro $\star$ 016.}
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item ``Our sole reason to exist is to become \textsc{Franxx} \& fight. We were born only for that purpose, raised only for that purpose. But to me, the failure of the group, that's something I can't forgive. With nowhere I can feel like I belong... that's when I met you.'' - Hiro's 1st narrative in Episode 01 preview
    	\item ``It was like I was put under a spell. Her two alluring horns, \& my 1st ever look at a naked girl's body, left me transfixed, unable to take my eyes off of her.'' - Hiro to himself, upon his 1st meeting with Zero Two
    	\item ``I feel myself going deeper inside you!'' - Hiro to Zero Two, piloting Strelizia for the second time 
    	\item ``Getting mocked for my lack of a partner would be one thing. But the fact that there was still a part of me that still hoped for one made me feel pathetic.'' - Hiro to himself after 1st meeting Zero Two
    	\item ``The act of bringing two pairs of lips together, which we'd never heard of, was called a kiss, she said.'' - Hiro remembering what a kiss means from Zero Two
    	\item  ''My wings exist for you. I'm your partner. I'm not going to leave you alone.'' - Hiro promising to be Zero Two's partner
    	\item ``It's only I met you, that I can stand here right now.'' - Hiro to Zero Two

    	\item ``You \& I; alone \& lonesome. With the wings that I tore apart with my own hands, it will never be possible again to fly away. The days that I could spend as your wing, the sky that I dreamed we could take to some day. It has all started fading away, far, far away.'' - Hiro about wanting to fly with Zero Two
    	\item ``And I called you a monster! Now we're even!'' - Hiro to Zero Two when they reconcile
    	\item ``I feel the same! Zero Two, I love you too!'' - Hiro declaring his love to Zero Two
    	\item ``If Zero Two can't smile for me, than I might as well be dead.'' - Hiro to Goro after announcing he is going to space 
    	\item ``Liar. If that were true, than why is your last page left blank? Don't fly off on your own. Please, Zero Two, let me stay with you. Together... let's rewrite that story.'' - Hiro to Zero Two before going into the warp gate
    	\item ``The distant skies. Beyond time \& distance. An overwhelmingly long journey just for the two of us. You're a part of me. I'm a part of you. I'll remember your warmth, along with the memories we've made together. I'll never let you go again!'' - Hiro \& Zero Two about their bond
    	\item ``I love you!'' - Hiro confessing to Zero Two

    \end{enumerate}
    {\sc Zero Two $\star$ 002.}
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item ``The Jian, also known as ``the bird that shares wings,'' only possesses one wing. Unless a male \& female pair lean on each other \& act as one, they're incapable of flight. They're imperfect, incomplete creatures. But, for some reason, their way of life, struck me as profoundly beautiful. It was beautiful, I felt.'' - Zero Two's narrative debut
    	\item ``I'm always alone, too. Thanks to these horns.''
    	\item ``I'm always alone, too. Thanks to these horns.'' - Zero Two talking to Hiro

    	\item ``Let me get a taste of you. After all... you are now my darling!'' - Zero Two declaring Hiro as her darling

    	\item ``Found you, my darling.'' - Zero Two about Hiro
    	\item ``Once we die, we'll just become a statistic. It won't matter what we were called. Just look at this lifeless city. There are no skies or oceans here. It's a one-way street to nowhere. A dead-end life.'' - Zero Two to Hiro while life looking at the city
    	\item ``Darling, wanna run away with me? I can get you out of here.'' - Zero Two to Hiro as they look at the inner city
    	\item ``You're mine. I love the way you taste. It's true: all the weaklings before died. That's to be expected. But you're special. Believe in me, okay, Darling?'' - Zero Two about Hiro
    	\item ``What is human to you people?'' - Zero Two to Ichigo
    	\item ``A kiss is something you share with your special someone. Is the one you kissed special to you?'' - Zero Two talking about a kiss with Ichigo

    	\item ``They're tiny fragments of memories. It's white, cold \& filled with things unknown, but it's beautiful. In the outside world that I felt for the 1st time, I heard a voice calling to me from somewhere. And before my eyes, a warm hand was reaching out for me.'' - Zero Two about her childhood memories
    	\item ``The leaving something behind part. My body can't do that. It's wonderful. You're all wonderful. You have the ability to decide your futures with your own hearts.'' - Zero Two to Squad 13
    	\item ``The distant skies. Beyond time \& distance. An overwhelmingly long journey just for the two of us. You're a part of me. I'm a part of you. I'll remember your warmth, along with the memories we've made together. I'll never let you go again!'' - Zero Two \& Hiro about their bond
    	\item ``And you are me... It doesn't matter how long it takes, as long as we have souls, I'm sure I will meet you again on Earth \& we'll pick up where we left off... I feel the same. I love you, darling.'' - Zero Two's last words before her death

    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item ``Maybe we can't win alone, but the two of us together can!'' - Ichigo to Goro after swimming in the klaxosaur to rescue him
    	\item ``She puts a curse to drain the life out of stamen, the one who's not human. I can't consider her as one of us anymore.

    \end{enumerate}
    {\sc Goro $\star$ 056.}
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item ``You are such a complete, utter fool!'' - Goro to Hiro about Hiro choosing to keep riding with Zero Two
    	\item ``Presents bring out special feelings. The feeling inspired by receiving something from someone. The feeling you get when you want to give something to someone. And then, there's that feeling when in the end, you couldn't give. I have been wondering for a long time what that emotion was, but it has finally hit me.'' - Goro about his feelings for Ichigo
    	\item ``Things keep changing. Until now, food, shelter, a reason to live, even a place to die, everything was only given to us. But, that's over too. Now, we have woken up from that long dream \& we will never go back to being CHILDREN. That choice, we made it on our own.'' - Goro after the parasites are abandoned
    	\item ``What do you mean, you feel bad? What do you mean, you want us to understand? Have you ever spared a thought for how the people close to you feel? You've always been like this: you run off, make your own decisions, \& never stop to think about us. Papa \& the adults are gone, but forget freedom, we've got our hands tied on every single thing. Have you stopped thinking about how worried we are about this? When someone collapses, all we can do is watch. And yet we're trying our damnest hard to live on! But here you are, running off to die. There are people doing all they can to support you because they want you to live. And you're trampling their feelings as you leave! What the hell do you want us to understand about you?!'' - Goro snapping at Hiro for wanting to go on a death mission
    	\item ``That was never about how everyone felt. It was all about me. I'm the one scared of the world that I chose myself.'' - Goro to Ichigo, about his rant earlier on
    	\item ``This is the path we've chosen in order to live. You don't get to fight it, either.'' - Goro to Hiro, after forgiving him
    \end{enumerate}
    {\sc Zorome $\star$ 666.}
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item ``I've never directly spoken with an adult. But they are always looking after us. If we do our best, they praise us \& even give us rewards. If I continue fighting for them, I'm sure that someday I can also become an adult. I've been dreaming forever for this day to come.'' - Zorome about his dream of becoming an adult
    	\item ``Hey! Nobody asked for a calm \& composed analysis!'' - Zorome to Mitsuru
    	\item ``Whoa, Whoa! Did you guys just try to press your bodies together? Are you imitating Hiro \& Zero Two?'' - To Kokoro \& Mitsuru
    	\item ``We won't become ADULTS. We just keep on fighting until we die. That's what we were born \& raised for. But, we're about to decide our own future. We're finally ready to take flight. Now is the time for us, nestlings, to leave the nest.'' - Zorome about the future

    	\item ``Better than the boys we're stuck with'' - To Kokoro about the stamen of Squad 26
    	\item ``The beginning of adolescence, it's just a small realization. You can't understand the others, \& they misunderstand you. It seems to me there's such a huge divide between us. A change of heart like this makes a lot of things that were obvious, not obvious anymore.'' - Miku prior to the Boys vs Girls conflict
    	\item ``Nana... Please help us?!'' - To Nana when the crops die
    	\item ``Do you think we will find that? Something that means the world to us, that we'd choose it over everything else?'' - To Zorome, Futoshi, Mitsuru, \& Ikuno
    \end{enumerate}
    {\sc Mitsuru $\star$ 326.}
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item ``I say Hiro's showing real integrity. It must be hard for him to face us after what happened, too. Spare a thought for how he feels.'' - Mitsuru speaking sarcastically about Hiro
    	\item ``If you place your hopes in anything, they will be betrayed. Promises will go unfulfilled \& faith will let you down.'' - Mitsuru to himself after dreaming about his broken childhood promise
    	\item ``In a name, there's power. While we were still young, when all we had was code numbers, you could say we lacked individuality. The one who gave us names was the young Hiro. At that time, you were a guidepost to us. But that's in the past. Right now, I don't expect anything from you.'' - Mitsuru about Hiro
    	\item ``Sure, Hiro was special. Even among the double-digits, he was a cut above. We were all certain that he'd be our leader \& show us the way. But reality had other ideas. Hiro couldn't become a parasite. He's not who he used to be. We must give up \& cut our losses. I don't want to see this pathetic side of Hiro anymore.'' - Mitsuru talking about Hiro to Ichigo
    	\item ``Doesn't it scare you to trust someone so much? You're unbelievable.'' - Mitsuru to Kokoro during their 1st sortie together in Genista

    	\item ``If I look up, I see thousands of lives shining deep in the sky. So far away \& although I try, I just can't reach out. Yet, even with broken wings, we'll fly away once again. For the promise we must keep. For the future we must pass on.'' - Mitsuru \& Kokoro about their future
    	\item ``Please don't say you have nothing. If you don't have anything, neither do I! But that's not true. I've found my reason to live... in you. I want to protect you \& that baby's future. I'm a weakling! And I don't really understand what love is, I don't. But if I'm with you, I can keep walking. That's what I've come to believe. Even without our memories, we can start over.'' - Mitsuru reconciling with Kokoro
    	\item ``I read an old book that said how you two feel means you love each other. We want our child, our Ai, to inherit that bond.'' - Mitsuru to Hiro \& Zero Two about Ai
    \end{enumerate}
    {\sc Kokoro $\star$ 556.}
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item ``We were raised in an institution \& now we live in the Bird Cage. There are so many things we don't know. Take the sea, for example. How it actually smells, the sound of the washing waves, the fact that sea water tastes salty. All those things that we'd only seen in books \& all those scenes, it was all kept intact there.'' - Kokoro about going to the beach for the 1st time
    	\item ``Do you know the language of flowers?'' - Kokoro to Mitsuru during the Boys x Girls fight

    	\item ``We lived our lives believing our only purpose was to ride the \textsc{Franxx} into battle. But you know what? That might not be true! We could carry new lives \& leave them for the future. When I learned about that, I was very happy.'' - Kokoro to Squad 13
    	\item ``Is it wrong to create a new life? Are we not allowed to think of the future?'' - Kokoro to Mitsuru about having a child
    	\item ``Together, we'll find happiness.'' - Kokoro to Mitsuru on their wedding day
    	\item ``f I look up, I see thousands of lives shining deep in the sky. So far away \& although I try, I just can't reach out. Yet, even with broken wings, we'll fly away once again. For the promise we must keep. For the future we must pass on.'' - Kokoro \& Mitsuru about their future

    	\item ``Look, there's your papa.'' - Kokoro to Ai, when Mitsuru arrives

    \end{enumerate}
    {\sc Futoshi $\star$ 214.}
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item ``If the Plantation has no magma-fuel, the city can't maintain function. That's why there's mining facilities everywhere, to keep digging out the fuel. It's the same with us \& food. When we eat lots, it gives us strength. So, let's eat!'' - Futoshi about magma energy providing necessities 
    	\item ``Will you promise to be my partner forever?!'' - Futoshi to Kokoro
    	\item ``The birdcage is still here. And so are we. The people we were supposed to protect aren't there anymore \& our wings are still being repaired, but we believe that the ten of us will all be able to fly again soon. Until then, we'll make it through on our own.'' - Futoshi after Squad 13 is left to fend for themselves
    \end{enumerate}
    {\sc Ikuno $\star$ 196.}
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item ``We're always fighting our fears. We might end up dragging down our partner. We might end up failing to move our \textsc{Franxx} correctly. We might become unnecessary. Will we be able to overcome our fears someday?'' - Ikuno about failing as a parasite
    	\item ``Everything comes to an end. The only difference is whether it comes sooner or later. And even though we sense the end is near, we spend another day, idling in the cradle of our lives.'' - Ikuno about life
    	\item ``A pain. Even if it is, so what?!'' - Ikuno to Alpha after he berated Kokoro
    	\item ``I love you, Ichigo.'' - Ikuno confessing her love to Ichigo
    	\item ``We will leave the birdcage when the sakura blooms. Together, we had our laughs \& we had our clashes. All these memories are as delicate as glass, but they're also the beautiful \& invaluable testimony that we were here.'' - Ikuno before leaving Mistilteinn
    	\item ``It's different for each person'' - To Miku about finding the most important thing in the world to them
    	\item ``I've decided to make most of the time I have left'' - To Hiro \& Zero Two about her accelerated aging process

    	\item ``Don't think you \& your squad are special'' - To Kokoro about her breaking the rules
    	\item ``CHILDREN are usually obedient, docile \& rational. They only live to fulfil their mission: fight the Klaxosaur \& protect the ADULTS. Not these kids. Too many times, they don't know what to do with their emotions \& get carried away. That's definitely not CHILD-like.'' - Nana talking about Squad 13 
    \end{enumerate}
    {\sc Hachi.}
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item ``The numbers conclusively prove Code 016's compatibility with Strelizia'' - Upon Hiro suffering no damage from his second sortie
    	\item ``Code 016 is hereby appointed Code 002's partner'' - Declaring Hiro as Zero Two's partner
    	\item ``We call the training facility for Parasites, the Garden. There, CHILDREN are brought up to develop a sound mind \& learn how to behave properly as CHILDREN, they are then pruned \& only the Parasites who leave the Garden's nest with their heads high have the honor of defending ADULTS against the Klaxosaur threat.'' - Hachi prior to taking Squad 13 to the Garden
    	\item ``That feeling... is having it that wrong? The children's sole purpose in life was to fight \& if this is truly their final battle, \& in their lives after, Don't you think they'll need someone like you.'' - Hachi to Nana about the children's future
    \end{enumerate}
    {\sc Papa.}
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item ``My children, you have had the good fortune to be chosen as parasites. Your great predecessors defended out cities \& our people, \& they splendidly took flight as our representatives. Turn your life into a blaze of glory \& shed every last drop of blood you have. I pray that you will become a shining ray of hope for humanity.'' - Papa to Squad 13 During the graduation ceremony

    	\item ``Humans have evolved \& cast their reproductive functions aside in the process. Reject that, \& we'll all have to go back to conforming to one gender'' - Alpha to Kokoro about her `leaving a mark'
    	\item ``The gender is a pain, an annoyance that's only tolerated to operate the \textsc{Franxx}? And that's all it really is.'' - Alpha criticizing Kokoro
    	\item ``Humans have also cast away their tendency to be ruled by emotions like that because it serves zero purpose in life.'' - Alpha to Ikuno after she slaps him
    	\item ``Meeting you guys helped me a little about being human, but my home is the battlefield \& nowhere else. Tell Iota hi for me. It's been kinda fun, I guess.'' - Alpha's last words before his death
    \end{enumerate}
    {\sc Dr. \textsc{Franxx}.}
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item ``Fate is cruel. In order to obtain something, one must lose something else. Humanity has searched \& sacrificed a lot for what lies beyond life which is our limit. And then we met her, such a beautiful \& perfect being.'' - Dr.\textsc{Franxx} about humanity \& 001
    	\item ``You two become the children's new adults'' - Dr. \textsc{Franxx}'s final wish upon his death
    \end{enumerate}
    {\sc New Nana.}
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item ``It is considered impossible for a pregnant woman to pilot a \textsc{Franxx}. Past records indicate abortion, that is the removal of the fetus as one of the possible treatments. Please let me know what you decide to do.'' - To Kokoro upon informing her of her pregnancy
    \end{enumerate}
    {\sc Naomi.}
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item ``I hope you find a good partner, Hiro'' - To Hiro when she leaves
    \end{enumerate}
    {\sc Klaxosaur Princess.}
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item ``I smell my brethren on you. It seems your sins are far too grave to be punished with mere death.''
    	\item ``Ah, the fake that the humans created. A duplicate that does not realize it is being used by the invaders.''
    	\item ``I shall devour your body \& soul.''
    	\item ``Damned human wannabes.'' - 001 about VIRM after killing Tarsier
    	\item ``We are the defenders of this planet. Once upon a time, during a long battle, we turned ourselves into an immortal weapon. Except fighting, all was lost, so we went to sleep at the bottom of death, our bond was to prepare for the returning invader.'' - 001 about the war with VIRM
    	\item ``Perhaps some lives only shine when in unison with others.'' - 001 about Hiro \& Zero Two's bond
    	\item ``Is this what living is for you? We believed that by abandoning our ties \& embracing solitude, we could perfect ourselves, make ourselves stronger. Very well. I shall give you every ounce of strength that remains within me. Whether or not you can take over the controls will be up to you. I stake this planet's future on you two.''
    	\item ``Decide whether you want to fight or accept your ruin.'' - 001's last words before she sacrifices herself \& entrusts the world's fate to Hiro \& Zero Two

    {\bf Narrator.}
   	\begin{itemize}
   		\item ``In this world, is the destiny of mankind controlled by some transcendental entity or law? Is it like the hand of god hovering above? At least it is true that man has no control; even over his own will.''
   		\item ``It was much too big to be called a sword. Massive, thick, heavy, \& far too rough. Indeed, it was like a heap of raw iron.''
   		\item ``Dreams, ambition, love, hope; in this world, could the glories of a youthful heart be $\ldots$ forbidden?''

That's how I live my life.'' - Walter White, Breaking Bad, Season 4, Hermanos

We read \& write poetry because we are members of the human race. \& the human race is filled with passion. \& medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits \& necessary to sustain life.

Our young men today are being told that women are whores, bitches, things to be screwed, beaten, shit on, \& shamed. This is a marketing holocaust. 24 hours a day for the rest of our lives, the powers that be are hard at work dumbing us to death.''

		\item ``I don't want to just say things to feel like I exist. I want to talk to relax. Words that make you feel relaxed.''
	\end{itemize}
	{\bf Yeom Gi-Jeong's friend.}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ``Even if you live alone, it's fine. You can be perfectly happy. You can eat whatever you want, whenever you want, \& sleep whenever you want.''
	\end{itemize}
	{\bf Yeom Je-Ho.}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ``Even when you don't know how you'll go onrun, if you pull yourself together, you can still find things that are bearable.''
	\end{itemize}
	{\bf Yeom Mi-Jeong.}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ``I think that's what this is all about. Finding out what my issue is.''
		\item ``5 minutes a day. If you have 5 minutes of peace, it's bearable.''
		\item ``Even if I thought I did a good job, if they said no, all the work I did would go down the drain.''
		\item ``When I get frustrated, I go out for a walk at night thinking, `I don't care if I die tonight.' I walk through a pitch-dark mountain.''
		\item ``Tonight, I have nothing to fear. I'll become a warrior.''
		\item ``When I wander around aimlessly, I can catch the briefest glimpse. `So that's what is in my head.' The feeling of being abandoned.''
		\item ``I think humans are only sane when they're lonely. So I think I'm saner at night.''
		\item ``I'm hungry. My face is burning up. I feel like I'll collapse.''
		\item ``He may be somebody at work, but he's a nobody outside.''
		\item ``I've never felt better after getting angry. It would take me 2 to 3 days to forget about it if I didn't get angry, but if I get angry, it lasts more than 10 days.''
		\item ``When I was a child, I was asked to hand in what we had prayed about at church. Looking at what my friends wrote, I thought, `Why would they pray for that? Grades, the school they want to get into, friends. They're seriously praying for that? To God? But it's God.' There was only 1 thing I was curious about. `What am I? Why am I here?'''
		\item ``I didn't exist before 1991 \& I won't exist in 50 years, but I feel like I existed before that \& will still exist after that. The feeling that I'll exist forever. I've been frustrated by that feeling \& I've never, in my heart, ever, felt settled.''
		\item ``I feel uneasy in bed, I feel uneasy around people. `Why can't I laugh happily like other people? Why am I sad all the time? Why am I always nervous? Why is everything so boring?''
		\item ``It feels like people are all scarecrows. They don't really know what they are. They're just acting as if they do.''
		\item ``People who say they live healthily \& happily maybe the people who decided to put all these questions behind them. People who have decided to lie \& say, `This is just how life is.' I'll never do that.''
		\item ``I don't care about where I'll go after I die. I want to see heaven while I'm alive.''
		\item ``It's bizarre when you see a thing somewhere it doesn't belong. A bird lying on the ground, a man hanging on a tree, even a dog on a farm.''
		\item ``I drink to feel high.'' -- Yeom Mi-Jeong
		
		``I drink to feel calm.'' -- Mr. Gu
		\item ``Why am I feeling sad? Why am I sad?''
		\item ``Then it's not food you want.''
		\item ``Out of the 24 hours in a day, I only feel okay for about a couple. \& it's not like I even feel good, I just feel okay. I just try to get through the rest.''
		\item ``I want liberation. I want to be liberated. I don't know where I'm trapped but I feel trapped. There's nothing in my life that relaxes me. I feel cramped \& stifled. I want to break free.''
		\item ``I'm not unhappy but I'm not happy either.''
		\item ``If you think about it, all the assholes in my life started with that same look in their eyes. Eyes that seemed to say, `You're not good enough.' It makes you feel so small. Like you're insignificant.''
		\item ``People are scared of thunder \& lightning but strangely, I find them calming.''
		\item ``It feels like I'm stuck but I don't know how to get out. That's probably why I hope everything ends all at once.''
		\item ``Everyone is on their way to their graves, so why is everyone so happy \& excited?''
		\item ``Sometimes, I think that people who are damaged are much more honest than those who live their lives happily.''
		\item ``I don't know where I'm stuck but I want to break free.''
		\item ``I wish I was genuinely happy \& be able to say things like `Yes, this is life,' `This is what life is all about.'''
		\item ``If we had lived in Seoul, would we have been any different?''
		\item ``If I imagine that I'm sitting here working next to you, even awful tasks like these turn into something beautiful. Work becomes bearable.''
		\item ``Rather than going through exhausting, difficult times without you, isn't it more admirable that I'm finding strength thinking of you?''
		\item ``No matter where I live, I think I would have been the same. I'd be living the same mundane life \& no on would ever be interested in me. I felt like if I lived like this for too long, I'd shrivel up \& die.''
		\item ``People are so good with words.''
		\item ``I want all of us to be happy. As bright \& cheery as a sunny day. Without so much as a crease in our hearts.''
		\item ``Maybe it's just me who's worth 20 points.''
		\item ``I'm exhausted. I don't know when it all started to go wrong, but I'm exhausted.''

		Don't you feel that our whole worlds collide?

	\item {\sc Luc Tartar.}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ``As for me, once the doubt had entered my mind, what other choice did it leave me but to search for the truth, in all fields?'' -- \cite{Tartar2006}
		\item ``To an uninformed observer, it may seem that there is more interest in the Navier--Stokes equation nowadays, but many who claim to be interested show such a lack of knowledge about continuum mechanics that one may wonder about such a superficial attraction. {\it Could one of the Clay Millennium Prizes be the reason behind this renewed interest?} Reading the text of the conjectures to be solved for winning that particular prize leaves the impression that the subject was not chosen by people interested in continuum mechanics, as the selected questions have almost no physical content.'' -- \cite[Preface, p. vii]{Tartar2006}		
		\item ``One should learn to distinguish between a mathematical property of an equation \& a conjecture that some property holds which one guesses from the belief that the equation corresponds to a physical problem. One should learn about which defects are already known concerning how a mathematical model describes physical reality, but one should not forget that a mathematical model which is considered obsolete from the physical point of view may still be useful for mathematical reasons. I often wonder why so many forget to mention the defects of the models that they study.'' -- \cite[Preface, p. vii]{Tartar2006}		
		\item ``If one had used the word ``turbulence'' to make the donator believe that he would be giving one million dollars away for an important realistic problem in continuum mechanics, why has attention been restricted to unrealistic domains without boundary (the whole space $\mathbb{R}^3$, or a torus for periodic solutions), as if one did not know that vorticity is created at the boundary of the domain? The problems seem to have been chosen in the hope that they will be solved by specialists of harmonic analysis, \& it has given the occasion to some of these specialists to help others in showing the techniques that they use, as in a recent book by \cite{Lemarie-Rieusset2016}'' -- \cite[Preface, p. viii]{Tartar2006}		
		\item ``Being a mathematician interested in science, \& having learnt more than most mathematicians about various aspects of mechanics \& physics, one reason for teaching various courses \& writing lecture notes is to help isolated researchers to learn about some aspects unknown to most mathematicians whom they could meet, or read. A consequence of this choice is then to make researchers aware that some who claim to work on problems of continuum mechanics or physics have forgotten to point out known defects of the models that they use.'' -- \cite[Preface, pp. viii--ix]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``Of course, I also suffer from the same disease of not having learnt enough\footnote{NQBH: i.e., imposter syndrome obviously.}, but my hope is that by explaining what I have already understood \& by showing how to analyze \& criticize classical models, many will acquire my understanding \& a few will go much further than I have on the path of discovery.'' -- \cite[Preface, p. ix]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``I once heard my advisor, Jacques-Louis LIONS, mention that once the detailed plan of a book is made, the book is almost written, \& he was certainly speaking of experience as he had already written a few books at the time. He gave me the impression that he could write directly a very reasonable text, which he gave to a secretary for typing; maybe he then gave chapters to one of his students, as he did with me for one of his books, \& very few technical details had to be fixed. His philosophy seemed to be that there is no need to spend too much time polishing the text or finding the best possible statement, as the goal is to take many readers to the front of research, or to be more precise to one front of research, because in the beginning he changed topics every two or three years.'' -- \cite[Preface, p. ix]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``As for myself, I have not yet written a book, \& the main reason is that I am quite unable to write in advance a precise plan of what I am going to talk about, \& I have never been very good at writing even in my mother tongue (French). When I write, I need to read again \& again what I have already written until I find the text acceptable (and that notion of acceptability evolves with time \& I am horrified by my style of twenty years ago), so this way of writing is quite inefficient, \& makes writing a book prohibitively long. One solution would be not to write books, \& when I go to a library I am amazed by the number of books which have been written on so many subjects, \& which I have not read, because I never read much. {\it Why then should I add a new book?} However, I am even more amazed by the number of books which are not in the library, \& although I have access to a good inter-library loan service myself, I became concerned with how difficult it is for isolated students to have access to scientific knowledge (and I do consider mathematics as part of science, of course).'' -- \cite[Preface, p. ix]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``It is clear that fewer \& fewer students in industrialized countries are interested in studying mathematics, for various reasons, \& as a consequence more \& more mathematicians are likely to come from developing countries. It will therefore be of utmost importance that developing countries should not simply become a reservoir of good students that industrialized countries would draw upon, but that these countries develop a sufficiently strong scientific environment for the benefit of their own economy \& people, so that only a small proportion of the new trained generations of scientists would become interested in going to work abroad.'' -- \cite[Preface, p. ix]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``I have seen the process of decolonization at work in the early 1960s, \& I have witnessed the consequences of too hasty a transition, which was not to the benefit of the former colonies, \& certainly the creation of a scientific tradition is not something that can be done very fast. I see the development of mathematics as a good way to start building a scientific infrastructure, \& inside mathematics the fields that I have studied should play an important role, where mathematics interacts with continuum mechanics \& physics.'' -- \cite[Preface, pp. ix--x]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``I decided at that time to add some information that one rarely finds in courses of mathematics, something about the people who have participated in the creation of the knowledge related to the subject of the course. I had the privilege to study in Paris in the late 1960s, to have great teachers like Laurent SCHWARTZ \& Jacques-Louis LIONS, \& to have met many famous mathematicians. This has given me a different view of mathematics than the one that comes from reading books \& articles, which I find too dry, \& I have tried to give a little more life to my story by telling something about the actors; for those mathematicians whom I have met, I have used their 1st names in the text, \& I have tried to give some simple biographical data for all people quoted in the text, in order to situate them, both in time \& in space.'' -- \cite[Preface, p. x]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``I observe that there have been efficient schools in some areas of mathematics at some places \& at some moments in time, \& when I was a student in Paris in the late 1960s, Jacques-Louis LIONS had mentioned that Moscow was the only other place comparable to Paris for its concentration of mathematicians. Although the conditions might be less favorable outside important centers, I want to think that a lot of good work could be done elsewhere, \& my desire is that my lecture notes may help isolated researchers participate more in the advance of scientific knowledge. A few years ago, an Italian friend, GianPietro DEL PIERO, told me that he had taught for a few months in Somalia, \& he mentioned that one student had explained to him that he should not be upset if some of the students fell asleep during his lectures, because the reason was not their lack of interest in the course, but the fact that sometimes they had eaten nothing for a few days. It was by thinking about these courageous students who, despite the enormous difficulties that they encounter in their everyday life, are trying to acquire some precious knowledge about mathematics, that I devised my plan to write lecture notes \& make them available to all, wishing that they could arrive freely to isolated students \& researchers, working in much more difficult conditions than those having access to a good library, or in contact with good teachers. I hope that publishing this revised version will have the effect that it will reach many libraries scattered around the world, where isolated researchers have access.'' -- \cite[Preface, p. xi]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``I hope that my lack of organizational skills will not bother the readers too much. I consider teaching courses like leading groups of newcomers into countries which are often unknown to them, but not unknown to me, as I have often wandered around; some members of a group who have already read about the region or have been in other expeditions with guides more organized than me might feel disoriented by my choice of places to visit, \& indeed I may have forgotten to show a few interesting places, but my goal is to familiarize the readers with the subject \& encourage them to acquire an open \& scientific point of view, \& not to write a definitive account of the subject.'' -- \cite[Preface, p. xii]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``There are results which are repeated, but it is inevitable in a real course that one should often recall results which have already been mentioned. There are also results which are mentioned without proof, \& sometimes they are proven later but sometimes they are not, \& if no references are given, one should remember that I have been trained as a mathematician, \& that my statements without proofs have indeed been proven in a mathematical sense, because if they had not I would have called them conjectures instead;\footnote{Some people like to talk of pure mathematics versus applied mathematics, but I do not think that such a distinction is accurate, as I mentioned in the introduction of an article for a conference at \'Ecole Polytechnique (Palaiseau, France) in the fall of 1983, but because that introduction was cut by political censors, it is worth repeating that for what concerns different parts of mathematics there are those which I know, those which I do not know well but think that they could be useful to me, \& those which I do not know well but do not see how they could be useful to me, \& all this evolves with time, so I finally wonder if it is reasonable to classify mathematics as being pure or applied. I consider myself as an ``applied'' mathematician, although I give it a French meaning (a mathematician interested in other fields of science), opposed to a British meaning (a specialist of continuum mechanics, allowed to use an incomplete mathematical proof without having to call the result a conjecture), \& in French universities, applied mathematicians in the British style are found in departments of m\'ecanique. Probably for the reason of funding, which strangely enough is given more easily to people who pretend to do applied research, some who have studied to become mathematicians practice the art of using words which make naive people wrongly believe that they know continuum mechanics or physics, \& I find this attitude potentially dangerous for the university system.} however, I am also human \& my memory is not perfect \& I may have made mistakes. I think that the right attitude in mathematics is to be able to explain all the statements that one makes, but in a course one has to assume that the reader already has some basic knowledge of mathematics, \& some proofs of a more elementary nature are omitted. Here \& there I mention a result that I have heard of, but for which I never read a proof or did not make up my own proof, \& I usually say so. If many proofs are mine it does not necessarily mean that I was the 1st to prove the corresponding result, but that I am not aware of a prior proof, maybe because I never read much. Actually, my advisor mentioned to me that it is useful to read only the statement of a theorem \& one should read the proof only if one cannot supply one.'' -- \cite[Preface, pp. xii--xiii]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``My personal mathematical training has been in functional analysis \& PDEs, starting at \'Ecole Polytechnique, Paris, France, where I had two great teachers, Laurent SCHWARTZ \& Jacques-Louis LIONS. Having studied there in order to become an engineer, but having had to change my orientation once I had been told that such a career required administrative skills (which I lack completely), I opted for doing research in mathematics with an interest in other sciences \& I asked Jacques-Louis LIONS to be my advisor, \& it was normal that once I had been taught enough on the mathematical side, I would apply my improved understanding to investigating questions of continuum mechanics \& physics which I had heard about as a student, \& to developing the new mathematical tools which are necessary for that.'' -- \cite[Preface, p. xiii]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``In my lectures I also try to teach mathematicians about the defects of the models used, but I want to apologize for some of the words which I use, which may have offended some. I have a great admiration for the achievements of physicists \& engineers\footnote{I am not mentioning biologists \& chemists because biology was not part of my studies, \& although I have learnt some chemistry, I only hope to understand it in a better way once my program for understanding continuum mechanics \& physics has progressed enough.} during the last century, \& a lot of the improvements in our lives result from their understanding, which is so different than the type of understanding that mathematicians are trained to achieve. If I write that something that they say does not make any sense, it is not a criticism towards physicists or engineers, who are following the rules of their profession, but it is a challenge to my fellow mathematicians that there is something there that mathematicians ought to clarify.'' -- \cite[Preface, p. xiii]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``Most problems are much too academic from the point of view of continuum mechanics, because the model used by Jean LERAY is too crude to be meaningful, \& the difficulties of the open questions are merely of a technical mathematical nature. Also, Jean LERAY unfortunately called turbulent the weak solutions that he was seeking, \& it must be stressed that turbulence is certainly not about regularity or lack of regularity of solutions, nor about letting time go to infinity either.'' -- \cite[Introduction, p. xv]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``It seems to have become my trade mark among mathematicians, that I do not want to lie about the usefulness of models when some of their defects have already been pointed out. This is obviously the way that any scientist is supposed to behave, but in explaining why I have found myself so isolated \& stubborn in maintaining that behavior, I have often invoked a question of religious training.'' -- \cite[Introduction, p. xvi]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``I am not good at following plans.'' -- \cite[Introduction, p. xvi]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``I opted for describing the general techniques for nonlinear partial differential equations that I had developed, {\it homogenization, compensated compactness} \& {\it H-measures}; there are obviously many important situations where they should be useful, \& I found it more important to teach them than to analyze in detail some particular models for which I do not feel yet how good they are (which means that I suspect them to be quite wrong). Regularly, I was trying to explain why what I was teaching had some connection with questions about {\it fluids}.'' -- \cite[Introduction, pp. xvi--xvii]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``It goes with my philosophy to {\it explain the origin of mathematical ideas} when I know about them, \& as my ideas are often badly attributed, I like to mention {\it why \& when I had introduced an idea}.'' -- \cite[Introduction, p. xvii]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``I have also tried to {\it encourage mathematicians to learn more about continuum mechanics \& physics}, listening to the specialists \& then trying to put these ideas into a sound mathematical framework.'' -- \cite[Introduction, p. xvii]{Tartar2006}
		\item ``The framework of functional analysis is not just a change of language, because it is crucial for understanding the point of view that I developed in the 1970s for relating what happens at a macroscopic level from the description at a microscopic{\tt/}mesoscopic level, using convergences of weak type (and not just weak convergences), which is quite a different idea than the game of using ensemble averages, which destroys the physical meaning of the problems considered.]'' -- \cite[Introduction, p. xvii]{Tartar2006}

Actually, I only play 1 game, DotA 2, which is good for training strategies \& concentration.

\subsubsection{DotA 2}
I have used DotA 2 as an ``intermediate break'': When I feel tired with words \& research, I will take some notes \& pause my work, I play some DotA 2 matches until I lose (if I win, I continue to find another {\sc mmr} match). The reason is simple: The toxicity of DotA 2 community \& stupidity of some DotA 2 players, especially in some matches I have done all my best to carry them, make me intellectually bored with gaming \& thus motivate me to get back to my research work. The boring--stimulating loop{\tt/}cycle will continue until the end of the day everyday.

	``The book is about the career of a professional mathematician from the 1930's--1980's. It is presented, more or less, in chronological order, from high school to retirement, but its sections are organized by substance rather than time. [$\ldots$] It expresses prejudices, it tells anecdotes, it gossips about people, \& it preaches sermons. It tells about taking prelims, looking for a job, writing a book, traveling, teaching, \& editing.
	
	50 years ago I was cocky, iconoclastic, eager, ambitious, in a hurry, ignorant, insecure. I have slowed down, mellowed (?), \& learned a few things. To some extent the book is from the me of today to the me of yore, revealing some of the secrets that I desperately wanted to know then.'' -- \cite[Overture]{Halmos1985}
	
	-- Cuốn sách nói về sự nghiệp của một nhà toán học chuyên nghiệp từ những năm 1930--1980. Nó được trình bày ít nhiều theo thứ tự thời gian, từ trung học đến nghỉ hưu, nhưng các phần của nó được sắp xếp theo nội dung hơn là theo thời gian. [$\ldots$] Nó thể hiện những thành kiến, nó kể những giai thoại, nó nói xấu về mọi người, \& nó rao giảng. Nó kể về việc tham gia các buổi sơ tuyển, tìm việc làm, viết sách, đi du lịch, giảng dạy, biên tập.
	
	50 năm trước, tôi là người tự mãn, theo chủ nghĩa bài trừ biểu tượng, háo hức, đầy tham vọng, vội vàng, ngu dốt, bất an. Tôi đã sống chậm lại, êm dịu (?), \& học được vài điều. Ở một mức độ nào đó, cuốn sách là từ tôi của ngày hôm nay đến tôi của ngày xưa, tiết lộ 1 số bí mật mà lúc đó tôi vô cùng muốn biết. 
	
	[time-traveling back to self-teach how to self-study]
	
	``6 people read every word of a typescript version of this book. Their comments (cut this out -- who was he? -- not so bad -- tone it down -- are you sure?) cheered me up, or made me mad, but, in either case, spurred me on.'' -- \cite[Thanks]{Halmos1985}
	
	-- 6 người đọc từng chữ trong phiên bản đánh máy của cuốn sách này. Những nhận xét của họ (bỏ câu này đi -- anh ấy là ai? -- không tệ lắm -- nói nhỏ lại -- bạn có chắc không?) đã cổ vũ tôi hoặc khiến tôi tức giận, nhưng, trong cả hai trường hợp, đều đã thúc đẩy tôi tiếp tục.
	
	``My expository style relies heavily on the exemplary singular, \& the construction ``everybody $\ldots$ his'' therefore comes up frequently. This ``his'' is	generic, not gendered. ``His or her'' becomes clumsy with repetition \& suggests that ``his'' alone elsewhere is masculine, which it isn't. ``Her'' alone draws attention to itself \& distracts from the topic at hand. ``Their'' solves the problem neatly but substitutes another. ``Ter'' is bolder than I am ready for. ``One's'' defeats the purpose of the construction, which is meant to be vivid \& particular. ``Its'' is too harsh a joke. Rather than play hob with the language, we feminists might adopt the position of pitying men for being forced to share their pronouns around.'' -- A note on pronouns from {\it A Handbook for Scholars}, by {\sc Mary-Claire Van Leunen} 1978.
	
	Phong cách trình bày của tôi chủ yếu dựa vào số ít mẫu mực, và do đó, cấu trúc ``mọi người $\ldots$ his'' xuất hiện thường xuyên. ``his'' này mang tính chung chung, không phân biệt giới tính. ``His or her'' trở nên vụng về khi lặp lại và gợi ý rằng chỉ riêng ``của anh ấy '' ở nơi khác là nam tính, nhưng không phải vậy. ``Ter'' táo bạo hơn mức tôi sẵn sàng. ``One's'' đánh bại mục đích của việc xây dựng, vốn có ý nghĩa sống động và đặc biệt. ngôn ngữ, chúng ta, những nhà hoạt động vì nữ quyền, có thể có lập trường thương hại đàn ông vì bị buộc phải chia sẻ đại từ của họ với mọi người.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \cite{Brown_Roediger_McDaniel_stick}. {\sc Peter C. Brown, Henry L. Roediger III, Mark A. McDaniel}. {\it Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning}.
	
	{\sf Amazon review.} The international bestseller that has helped millions of students, teachers, \& lifelong learners use proven approaches to learn better \& remember longer.
	
	``We have made {\it Make It Stick} a touchstone for our instructors $\ldots$ to gain a real advantage for our learners as they tackle some of the toughest work in the world.'' -- {\sc Carl Czech}, former Senior Instructional Systems Specialist{\tt/}Advisor, US Navy SEALs
	
	Are you tired of forgetting what you learn? This groundbreaking book, based on the latest research in cognitive science, offers powerful strategies to boost memory \& learning.
	
	To most of us, learning something ``the hard way'' means wasted time \& effort. Good teaching, many believe, should be tailored to the different learning styles of students \& should use strategies that make learning easier. {\it Make It Stick} turns fashionable ideas like these on their head. Drawing on recent discoveries in cognitive psychology \& a 10-year collaboration among some of the world's leading experts on human learning \& memory, the authors explain what {\it really} drives successful learning. With clear, real-world examples, they show how we can confidently hone our skills \& learn more effectively.
	
	Many common study habits simply don't work. Underlining, highlighting, rereading, cramming, \& single-minded repetition of new skills create the illusion of mastery, but gains fade quickly. Science shows that more durable learning comes from self-testing, introducing certain difficulties in practice, waiting to re-study new material until a little forgetting has occurred, \& interleaving the practice of 1 skills or topic with another. {\it Make It Stick} breaks down these proven approaches in compelling ways \& offers concrete techniques for becoming more productive learners.
	
	Full of eye-opening \& inspiring stories for students, educators, \& parents, {\it Make It Stick} is an indispensable guide for all those interested in the challenge of lifelong learning \& self-improvement.
	\begin{quotation}
		{\it``Elaboration is the process of giving new material meaning by expressing it in your own words \& connecting it with what you already know.''}
		
		-- Xây dựng là quá trình tạo ra ý nghĩa vật chất mới bằng cách diễn đạt nó bằng từ ngữ của riêng bạn \& kết nối nó với những gì bạn đã biết.
		
		{\it``Trying to solve a problem before being taught the solution leads to better learning, even when errors are made in the attempt.''}
		
		-- Cố gắng giải quyết một vấn đề trước khi được dạy giải pháp sẽ dẫn đến việc học tập tốt hơn, ngay cả khi mắc lỗi trong nỗ lực đó.
		
		{\it``Learning is stronger when it matters, when the abstract is made concrete \& personal.''}

		{\it``Mastery requires both the possession of ready knowledge \& the conceptual understanding of how to use it.''}

	{\sf Editorial reviews.}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ``If you want to read a lively \& engaging book on the science of learning, this is a must $\ldots$ {\it Make It Stick} benefits greatly from its use of stories about people who have achieved mastery of complex knowledge \& skills. Over the course of the book, the authors weave together stories from an array of learners -- surgeons, pilots, gardeners, \& school \& university students -- to illustrate their arguments about how to successful learning takes place $\ldots$ This is a rich \& resonant book \& a pleasurable read that will leave you pondering the processes through which you, \& your students, acquire new knowledge \& skills.'' -- {\sc Hazel Christie}, {\it Times Higher Education}
		\item ``Many educators are interested in making use of recent findings about the human brain \& how we learn $\ldots$ {\it Make It Stick} [is] the single best work I have encountered on the subject. Anyone with an interest in teaching or learning will benefit from reading this book, which not only presents thoroughly grounded research but does so in an eminently readable way that is accessible even to students.'' -- {\sc James M. Lang}, {\it Chronicle of Higher Education}
		\item ``We have made {\it Made It Stick} a touchstone for our instructors $\ldots$ to gain a real advantage for our learners as they tackle some of the toughest work in the world.'' -- {\sc Carl Czech}, former Senior Instructional Systems Specialist{\tt/}Advisor, US Navy SEALs
		\item ``It is surprising to me [that] we have such highly educated people coming to medical school who haven't thought that deeply about learning. I feel like we are teaching the gospel of {\it Make It Stick} during our 1st weeks with the students $\ldots$ With the immense time pressure you have as a medical student, the importance of these principles becomes very clear to them.'' -- {\sc Randall King}, Harry C. McKenzie Professor of Cell Biology, Harvard Medical School
		\item ``It's an illuminating read $\ldots$ Learning ability is probably the most important skill you can have. Unfortunately, lots of the techniques for learning that we pick up in school don't help with long-term recall -- like cramming or highlighting $\ldots$ For a deeper dig into the science of learning, make sure to pick up {\it Make It Stick}.'' -- {\sc Drake Baer}, {\it Business Insider}
		\item ``Aimed primarily at students, parents, \& teachers, {\it Make It Stick} also offers practical advice for learners of all ages, at all stages of life $\ldots$ With its credible challenge to conventional wisdom, {\it Make It Stick} does point the way forward, with a very real prospect of tangible \& enduring benefits.'' -- {\sc Glenn C. Altschuler}, {\it Psychology Today}
		\item ``{\it Make It Stick} will help you become a much more productive learner. [It] presents a compelling case fo why we are attracted to the wrong strategies for learning \& teaching -- \& what we can do to remedy our approaches $\ldots$ In clear language, {\it Make It Stick} explains the science underlying how people learn. But the authors don't simply recite the research; they show readers how it is applied in real-life learning scenarios, with engaging stories of real people in academic, professional, \& sports environments $\ldots$ The learning strategies proposed in this book can be implemented immediately, at no cost, \& to great effect.'' -- {\sc Stephanie Castellano}, {\it TD Magazine}
		\item ``If I could, I would assign all professors charged with teaching undergraduates 1 book: {\it Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning} $\ldots$ It lays out what we know about the science of learning in clear, accessible prose. Every educator -- \& parent, \& student, \& professional -- ought to have it on their own personal syllabus.'' -- {\sc Annie Murphy Paul}, author of {\it The Extended Mind}
		\item ``The authors have provided a great service for educators by capturing the important lessons from decades of research in the learning sciences $\ldots$ It should be highly recommended reading for anyone in the teaching, learning, \& training professions.'' -- {\sc Robert H. Bruininks}, Professor \& President Emeritus, University of Minnesota
		\item ``This is a quite remarkable book. It describes important research findings with startling implications for how we can improve our own learning, teaching, \& coaching. Even more, it shows us how more positive attitudes toward our own learning, teaching, \& coaching. Even more, it shows us how more positive attitudes toward our own abilities -- \& the willingness to tackle the hard stuff -- enables us to achieve our goals. The compelling stories bring the ideas out of the lab \& into the real world.'' -- {\sc Robert Bjork}, University of California, Los Angeles
		\item ``Learning is essential \& life-long. Yet as these authors argue convincingly, people often use exactly the wrong strategies \& don't appreciate the ones that work. We've learned a lot in the last decade about applying cognitive science to real-world learning, \& this book combines everyday examples with clear explanations of the research. It's easy to read -- \& should be easy to learn from, too!'' -- {\sc Daniel L. Schacter}, author of {\it The 7 Sins of Memory}
		\item ``Anyone who teaches anything would benefit from reading this book: coaches, tutors, classroom teachers, parents, even corporate trainers. Instead of dong what we've always done \& wondering why some learners just don't get it, we can take a different approach that's based on research, even if it seems counterintuitive.'' -- {\sc Jennifer Gonzales}, {\it Cult of Pedagogy}

		\item ``Thật khó hình dung cô gái nhỏ nhắn, gầy gò, nhợt nhạt đang ngồi trước mặt lại chính là cô gái đã ở trong vòng tay tôi đêm qua, hét lên những tiếng hân hoan nhục cảm dưới ánh trăng mùa đông rọi vào từ cửa sổ.'' -- \cite[Trên Gối Đá, p. 14]{Murakami_ngoi_1}
		\item ``Nhưng liệu con người ta có thể làm 1 vụ quấy rối kỳ công đến như vậy chỉ vì ghét không? Việc in bưu thiếp chắc chắc là tốn kém. Con người có thể xấu tính đến mức ấy ư? Tôi không nhớ mình đã làm gì để bị cô ghét. Nhưng đôi khi, ta chà đạp lên cảm xúc của người khác, xúc phạm danh dự hoặc khiến họ khó chịu mà ta không nhận ra.'' -- \cite[Kem, pp. 34--35]{Murakami_ngoi_1}
		\item ``Kỳ lạ thay, khi mở tập thơ, lướt qua những bài thơ được in bằng chữ màu đen cỡ lớn, sau đó đọc lên thành tiếng, cơ thể cô mà tôi đã nhìn thấy dưới ánh nắng vào buổi sáng hôm sau mà là cơ thể với làn da sáng mịn nằm trong vòng tay tôi dưới ánh trăng. Bầu vú tròn trịa, đầu vú nhỏ \& cứng, lông mu đen \& thưa, âm đạo ướt đẫm. Lúc lên đỉnh, cô nghiến chặt chiếc khăn, mắt nhắm nghiền, liên tục gọi da diết tên 1 người đàn ông bên tai tôi. 1 cái tên rất đỗi bình thường mà tôi không tài nào nhớ ra.'' -- \cite[Trên Gối Đá, p. 19]{Murakami_ngoi_1}
		\item ````Nghe này, hãy tưởng tượng bằng năng lực của mình. Vắt kiệt trí thông minh để hình dung ra. 1 hình tròn có nhiều tâm, đã vậy lại không có đường ngoại biên. Nỗ lực 1 cách nghiêm túc như thể phải trầy da tróc vẩy vậy, khi đó cậu mới dần nhận ra hình tròn đó trông như thế nào.''
		
		``Có vẻ khó nhỉ,'' tôi nói.
		
		``Hiển nhiên rồi,'' ông nói như vừa nhổ đi 1 vật cứng. ``Trên đời này chẳng có thứ gì giá trị mà lại có được dễ dàng cả.'' Rồi ông khẽ đằng hắng, rành rọt như thể ngắt câu xuống dòng. ``Nhưng, khi đạt được thứ khó khăn đó với nhiều thời gian \& công sức, thứ đó sẽ trở thành kem của cuộc đời.''
		
		$\ldots$ trong tiếng Pháp có câu `cr\`eme de la cr\`eme' $\ldots$
		
		``Kem của kem, nghĩa là thứ tốt nhất trong những thứ tốt nhất. Tinh hoa quan trọng nhất của cuộc đời $\ldots$ đó chính là `cr\`eme de la cr\`eme'. Cậu hiểu không? Còn lại thì toàn là những thứ nhạt nhẽo, vô giá trị'''' -- \cite[Kem, pp. 39--40]{Murakami_ngoi_1}
		
		``Có lúc, tôi cảm giác như mình gần như đã lý giải được chuyện đó, nhưng khi suy nghĩ sâu hơn, tôi lại không hiểu gì nữa. Chuyện đó cứ lặp đi lặp lại. Nhưng có lẽ, đó không phải là hình tròn với hình dạng cụ thể mà là hình tròn chỉ tồn tại trong tâm trí của con người. Tôi nghĩ vậy. Rằng khi chúng ta thật lòng yêu ai đó, cảm thông sâu sắc với điều gì đó, có lý tưởng về thế giới này, tìm thấy niềm tin (hoặc thứ giống như niềm tin), chúng ta sẽ hiểu \& chấp nhận sự tồn tại của hình tròn đó như lẽ đương nhiên. Tất nhiên đây chỉ là suy diễn mơ hồ của tôi.
		
		Đầu óc của cậu là để suy nghĩ những thứ khó. Biến điều không biết thành biết. Thứ đó sẽ trở thành kèm của cuộc đời. Còn lại thì toàn là những thứ nhạt nhẽo, vô giá trị.'' -- \cite[Kem, p. 44]{Murakami_ngoi_1}
		\item ``Trong suốt nhiều năm, tôi quên hẳn mình đã từng viết bài luận đó hồi sinh viên. Phần vì đời sống của tôi sau này hối hả hơn tôi tưởng, vả lại, bài phê bình âm nhạc giả tưởng đó rốt cuộc cũng chỉ là 1 trò đùa tắc trách vô ưu thời tuổi trẻ. Tuy nhiên, khoảng 15 năm sau, bài luận đó đã trở về với tôi theo 1 cách đầy bất ngờ. Hệt như cái boomerang ta quên bẵng mình đã ném đi bỗng nhiên bay về vào lúc ta không ngờ đến.'' -- \cite[Charlie Parker Plays Bossa Nova, p. 55]{Murakami_ngoi_1}
		\item ``Khi tiếp tục lang thang tản bộ sau đó, đột nhiên cảm giác hối hận dâng trào trong tôi. Lẽ ra tôi nên mua đĩa hát đó. Dù đó là đĩa hát giả mạo vô nghĩa, dù giá của nó quá đắt đi nữa thì vẫn nên mua. Coi như 1 món đồ kỷ niệm kỳ quặc trong cuộc đời nhiều ngã rẽ của tôi.'' -- \cite[Charlie Parker Plays Bossa Nova, p. 57]{Murakami_ngoi_1}
		\item ``Tôi chỉ có thể nói đó là thứ âm nhạc chạm được tới nơi sâu thẳm nhất trong tâm hồn. Thứ âm nhạc mà trước \& sau khi nghe, ta dường như thấy cấu tạo cơ thể mình đã khác đi đôi chút $\ldots$ Quả thật, trên thế giới có tồn tại thứ âm nhạc như vậy.'' -- \cite[Charlie Parker Plays Bossa Nova, p. 61]{Murakami_ngoi_1}

	{\sf Amazon review.} Amoral, cunning, ruthless, \& instructive, this multi-million-copy {\it New York Times} bestseller is the definitive manual for anyone interested in gaining, observing, or defending against ultimate control -- from the author of {\it The Laws of Human Nature}.
	
	In the book that {\it People} magazine proclaimed ``beguiling'' \& ``fascinating,'' {\sc Robert Greene} \& {\sc Joost Elffers} have distilled 3000 years of the history of power into 48 essential laws by drawing from the philosophies of {\sc Machiavelli, Sun Tzu}, \& {\sc Carl Von Clausewitz}, \& also from the lives of figures ranging from {\sc Henry Kissinger} to {\sc P.T. Barnum}.
	
	Some laws teach the need for prudence (``Law 1: Never Outshine the Master''), others teach the value of confidence (``Law 28: Enter Action with Boldness''), \& many recommend absolute self-preservation (``Law 15: Crush Your Enemy Totally''). Every law, though, has 1 thing in common: an interest in total domination. In a bold \& arresting 2-color package, {\it The 48 Laws of Power} is ideal whether your aim is conquest, self-defense, or simply to understand the rules of the game.
	\begin{quotation}
		{\it``Never take your position for granted \& never let any favors you receive go to your head.''}
		
		{\it``Never waste valuable time, or mental peace of mind, on the affairs of others -- that is too high a price to pay.''}
		
		{\it``When it comes to power, outshining the master is perhaps the worst mistake of all.''}
		
		{\it``Impatience, on the other hand, only makes you look weak. It is a principal impediment to power.''}
	\end{quotation}
	{\sf Editorial reviews.}

		\item ``{\sc Machiavelli} has a new rival. \& {\sc Sun Tzu} had better watch his back. {\sc Green} $\ldots$ has put together a checklist of ambitious behavior. Just reading the table of contents is enough to stir a little corner-office lust.'' -- {\it New York} magazine
		\item ``Beguiling $\ldots$ literate $\ldots$ fascinating. A wry primer for people who desperately want to be on top.'' -- {\it People} magazine
		\item ``An heir to {\sc Machiavelli}'s {\it Prince} $\ldots$ gentler souls will find this book frightening, those whose moral compass is oriented solely to power will have a perfect {\it vade mecum}.'' -- {\it Publishers Weekly}

	{\sf Amazon review.} From the \#1 New York Times-bestselling author of {\it The 48 Laws of Power} comes the definitive new book on decoding the behavior of the people around you.{\sc Robert Greene} is a master guide for millions of readers, distilling ancient wisdom \& philosophy into essential texts for seekers of power, understanding \& mastery. Now he turns to the most important subject of all -- understanding people's drives \& motivations, even when they are unconscious of them themselves.
	
	We are social animals. Our very lives depend on our relationships with people. Knowing why people do what they do is the most important tool we can possess, without which our other talents can only take us so far. Drawing from the ideas \& examples of {\sc Pericles, Queen Elizabeth I, Martin Luther King Jr.}, \& many others, {\sc Greene} teaches us how to detach ourselves from our own emotions \& master self-control, how to develop the empathy that leads to insight, how to look behind people's masks, \& how to resist conformity to develop your singular sense of purpose. Whether at work, in relationships, or in shaping the world around you, {\it The Laws of Human Nature} offers brilliant tactics for success, self-improvement, \& self-defense.

		\item ``The writing in engaging \& the ideas are fascinating $\ldots$ we could all use the insights {\sc Greene} provides $\ldots$ a hopeful book that advocates freedom \& creativity.'' -- {\it Quartz}
		\item ``The lessons have profound implications. There's a chapter on reading body language that is absolutely profound; each ``law'' has stunningly vivid descriptions of an historical figure.'' --Inc.
		\item ``{\it The Laws of Human Nature} provides some 1st-rate comprehensive \& in-depth information about how to deal with our fellow human beings effectively. {\sc Greene}'s intense curiosity about the inner workings of humanity is contagious, as he invites us to join him as fellow sleuths on his investigation of why people, including ourselves, do what we do. He rightly (\& frequently) reminds us that in order to understand others, we must 1st \& foremost understand what makes ourselves tick.'' -- New York Journal of Books
		\item ``In this detailed \& expansive guide, {\sc Green} ({\it Mastery}) seeks to $\ldots$ transform the reader into a `calmer \& more strategic observer', immune to `emotional drama.' Those are lofty promises, but even skeptics will become believers after diving into {\sc Greene}'s well-organized text. Overcoming the ``law of irrationality,'' e.g., leads to the ability to ``open your mind to what is really happening, as opposed to what you are feeling.'' {\sc Greene}'s thoughtful examination of self \& society will, for the committed reader, deliver a refreshing \& revitalizing perspective.'' -- {\it Publishers Weekly}
		\item ``{\sc Greene}'s specialty is analyzing the lives \& philosophies of historical figures like {\sc Sun Tzu} \& {\sc Napoleon}, \& extracting from them tips on how to manipulate people \& situations -- a cutthroat worldview that has earned him a devoted following among a like-minded readership of rappers, drug dealers \& corporate executives.'' -- {\it The New York Times}

	Our brains do their best to help us out, bu every so often they can be real assholes -- having melt downs, getting addicted to things, or shutting down completely at the worst possible moments.

	We work feverishly\footnote{1. in a way that shows strong feelings of excitement or worry, often with a lot of activity or quick movements; 2. in a way that is caused by a fever ($=$ a high temperature).} to make ourselves happy. So why are we so miserable?
	
	Despite our constant search for new ways to optimize our bodies \& minds for peak performance, human beings are working more instead of less, living harder not smarter, \& becoming more lonely \& anxious. We strive for the absolute best in every aspect of our lives, ignoring what we do well naturally \& reaching for a bar that keeps rising higher \& higher. Why do we measure our time in terms of efficiency instead of meaning? Why can't we just take a break?
	
	In {\it Do Nothing}, award-winning journalist {\sc Celeste Headlee} illuminates a new path ahead, seeking to institute a global shift in our thinking so we can stop sabotaging our well-being, put work aside, \& start living instead of doing. As it turns out, we're searching for external solutions to an internal problem. We won't find what we're searching for in punishing diets, productivity apps, or the latest self-improvement schemes. Yet all is not lost -- we just need to learn how to take time for ourselves, without agenda or profit, \& redefine what is truly worthwhile.
	
	Pulling together threads from history, neuroscience, social science, \& even paleontology (cổ sinh vật học). {\sc Headlee} examines long-held assumptions about time use, idleness, hard work, \& even our ultimate goals. Her research reveals that the habits we cling to are doing us harm; they developed recently in human history, which means they are habits that can, \& must, be broken. It's time to reverse the trend that's making us all sadder, sicker, \& less productive, \& return to a way of life that allows us to thrive.

	Today most of us communicate from behind electronic screens, \& studies show that Americans feel less connected \& more divided than ever before. The blame for some of this disconnect can be attributed to our political landscape, but the erosion of our conversational skills as a society lies with us as individuals.
	
	\& the only way forward, says {\sc Headlee}, is to start talking to each other. In {\it We Need to Talk}, she outlines the strategies that have made her a better conversationalist -- \& offers simple tools that can improve anyone's communication. E.g.:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item BE THERE OR GO ELSEWHERE. Human beings are incapable of multitasking, \& this is especially true of tasks that involve language. Think you can type up a few emails while on a business call, or hold a conversation with your child while texting your spouse? Think again.
		\item CHECK YOUR BIAS. The belief that your intelligence protects you more vulnerable to them. We are have blind spots that affect the way we view others. Check your bias before you judge someone else.
		\item HIDE YOUR PHONE. Don't just put down your phone, put it away. New research suggests that the mere presence of a cell phone can negatively impact the quality of a conversation.
	\end{itemize}
	Whether you're struggling to communicate with your kid's teacher at school, an employee at work, or the people you love the most -- {\sc Headlee} offers smart strategies that can help us all have conversations that matter.

	{\sf Amazon review.} Doing well with money isn't necessarily about what you know. It's about how you behave. \& behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people.
	
	Money -- investing, personal finance, \& business decisions -- is typically taught as a math-based field, where data \& formulas tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world people don't make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your own unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, \& odd incentives are scrambled together.
	
	In {\it The Psychology of Money}, award-winning author {\sc Morgan Housel} shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money \& teaches you how to make better sense of 1 of life's most important topics.

	Already a major international bestseller, this eye-opening \& accessible follow-up to the ``compelling'' ({\sc Marc Andreessen}) worldwide phenomenon {\it The Courage to Be Disliked} shares the powerful teachings of {\sc Alfred Adler}, 1 of the giants of 19th-century psychology, through another illuminating dialogue between the philosopher \& the young man.
	
	3 years after their 1st conversation, the young man finds himself disillusioned \& disappointed, convinced {\sc Adler}'s teachings only work in theory, not in practice. But through further discussions between the philosopher \& the young man, they deepen their own understandings of {\sc Adler}'s powerful teachings, \& learn the tools needed to apply {\sc Adler}'s teachings to the chaos of everyday life.
	
	To be read on its own or as a companion to the bestselling 1st book, {\it The Courage to Be Happy} reveals a bold new way of thinking \& living, empowering you to let go of the shackles of past trauma \& th expectations of others, \& to use this freedom to create the life you truly desire.
	
	Plainspoken yet profoundly moving, reading {\it The Courage to Be Happy} will light a torch with the power to illuminate your life \& brighten the world as we know it. Now you can discover the courage to choose happiness.

		{\it``With regard to memory, think of it like this: from the innumerable events that have happened in a person's past, that person chooses only those events that are compatible with the present goals, gives meaning to them \& turns them into memories. \& conversely, events that run counter to the present goals are erased.''}
		
		-- Về trí nhớ, hãy nghĩ như thế này: trong vô số sự kiện đã xảy ra trong quá khứ của một người, người đó chỉ chọn những sự kiện phù hợp với mục tiêu hiện tại, gán cho chúng ý nghĩa \& biến chúng thành ký ức. \& ngược lại, những sự kiện đi ngược lại mục tiêu hiện tại sẽ bị xóa.
		
		{\it``Was one bitten by a dog? Or was one helped by another person? The reason Adlerian psychology is considered a `psychology of use' is this aspect of `being able to choose one's own life'. The past does not decide `now'. It is your `now' that decides the past.''}
		
		-- Có bị chó cắn không? Hay một người đã được người khác giúp đỡ? Lý do tâm lý học Adlerian được coi là “tâm lý học sử dụng” là do khía cạnh “có thể lựa chọn cuộc sống của chính mình”. Quá khứ không quyết định ‘bây giờ’. Chính cái ‘bây giờ’ của bạn mới quyết định quá khứ.

	{\sf Author’s Note.}  ``{\sc Alfred Adler}, the thinker who was 100 years ahead of his time. Though he stands beside {\sf Sigmund Freud} \& {\sc Carl Gustav Jung} as 1 of the most important figures in the world of psychology, {\sc Adler} was for many years a ``forgotten giant.'' Since the publication of {\it The Courage to Be Disliked}, the context of {\sc Adler} \& his school of thought has gone through a remarkable transformation. {\sc Adler} has been widely known in Europe \& America for some time. But now, after our book spent a record-setting 51 weeks as a \#1 bestsheller -- having sold milliosn of copies in South Korea \& Japan -- I have a strong sense that {\sc Adler} is present within many people, \& no longer needs introduction. There is something deeply moving about his ideals being accepted in Asia after the passage of 100 years.
	
	{\it The Courage to Be Disliked} is a kind of map for informing people of the existence of Adlerian psychology, \& for giving an overview of {\sc Adler}'s ideas. It is a grand map that we put together over the course of several years, with the intention of creating a definitive introduction to Adlerian psychology.
	
	{\it The Courage to Be Happy}, once more we find the philosopher engaged in a dialogue with the pessimistic youth. 3 years after the conclusion of {\it The Courage to Be Disliked}, the youth, who has become a teacher with the intention of putting {\sc Adler}'s ideas into practice, calls on the philosopher 1 last time. Frustrated with Adlerian psychology \& angry with the philosopher for introducing him to {\sc Adler}'s ideals, the youth has returned to the philosopher's study to challenge everything the philosopher taught him \& insist that he cease to corrupt other young minds with ideals that don't hold up in the real world when interacting with real people. Calmly, the philosopher invites the youth to join him for 1 final conversation about having courage not only to take the 1st step toward happiness, but to continue walking along the path of self-improvement in order to love, be self-reliant, \& nurture community feeling.
	
	In what way can we make concrete progress on the path to happiness shown in the preceding volume, {\it The Courage to Be Disliked?} How can we put Adlerian psychology into practice in our everyday lives? \& what is that conclusion arrived at by {\sc Adler}, ``the biggest choice in life,'' that everyone must make in order to live in happiness?
	
	The curtain opens once more on this strong-medicine philosophical dialogue. Do you have the {\it courage} to climb the stairway of understanding with the youth?

	{\sf Amazon review.} 2017 Reprint of 1933 U.S. Edition. Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition software. Considered by many to be 1 of the most important books in the field of psychology, {\it Modern Man in Search of a Soul} is a comprehensive introduction to the thought of {\sc Carl Gustav Jung}. The writing covers a broad array of subjects e.g. gnosticism, theosophy, Eastern philosophy \& spirituality in general. The 1st part of the book deals with dream analysis in its practical application, the problems \& aims of modern psychotherapy, \& also his own theory of psychological types. The middle section addresses {\sc Jung}'s beliefs about the stages of life \& Archaic man. He also contrasts his own theories with those of {\sc Sigmund Freud}. In the latter parts of the book {\sc Jung} discusses psychology \& literature \& devotes a chapter to the basic postulates of analytical psychology. The last 2 chapters are devoted to the spiritual problem of modern man in aftermath of World War I. He compares it to the flowering of gnosticism in the 2nd century \& investigates how psychotherapists are like the clergy.

	When {\sc Harold Kushner}'s 3-year-old son was diagnosed with a degenerative disease that meant the boy would only live until his early teens, he was faced with 1 of life's most difficult questions: Why, God? Years later, {\sc Rabi Kushner} wrote this straightforward, elegant contemplation of the doubts \& fears that arise when tragedy strikes. In these pages, {\sc Kushner} shares his wisdom as a rabbi, a parent, a reader, \& a human being. Often imitated but never superseded, {\it When Bad Things Happen to Good People} is a classic that offers clear thinking \& consolation\footnote{sự an ủi.} in times of sorrow.

	{\sf Amazon review.} Do you feel confused \& exhausted by a relationship, \& you can't figure out why? Do you feel like you can't think straight, \& the person in your life seems fine, so you wonder if maybe you are the problem?
	
	Has someone mentioned you might be with a narcissist, or you wonder yourself, \& when you research narcissism, they don't seem completely fit the description, although some of the traits do ring true?
	
	{\it The Covert Passive Aggressive Narcissist} is the most comprehensive \& helpful book on the topic of covert narcissism. Also available in Spanish as El Nacisista Pasivo Agresivo. Find the answers you are looking for. This book delivers:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A list of traits of the covert narcissist \& how they look like in daily life
		\item The differences between an overt \& a covert narcissist
		\item A checklist to see if you are with a covert narcissist
		\item Real-life stories to illustrate what these traits look like
		\item Explanations of different covert techniques narcissists use to control \& manipulate
		\item A chapter dedicated to what sex looks like with a covert narcissist
		\item Descriptions of covertly narcissist parents Information on what it looks like to have a covertly narcissistic boss or co-worker
		\item A chapter on healing to help give you tools \& hope for a beautiful future, free of toxic relationships.
	\end{itemize}
	You will see that you are not crazy, that your instincts are correct, \& you will learn how to see through covert manipulation \& control.
	
	The most common description a survivor of this type of relationship will use is crazy-making. The emotional abuse \& gaslighting makes you question your own view of reality, \& sometimes your own sanity. You will know after reading this book if the person you are with is a covert narcissist, \& your experience with them will begin to make sense for the 1st time.
	
	When most people think of a narcissist, they think of someone who is grandiose, obviously self-absorbed, sees themselves as superior to others, \& throws fits of rage when they don't get their way. But what if the narcissists is 1 of the nicest people you've ever met? What if they are a great listener, seem to care about others, or are a pillar of the community? What if they are the mother that volunteers at the school, the husband that your friends wish they had, the boss that your co-workers feel so lucky to work for? Parents, spouses, partners, bosses, \& friends who are covert narcissists come across as the nicest people. They can be spiritual leaders, therapists, moms who bring over casseroles to needy people, \& bosses who everyone loves.
	
	A covert narcissist has the same traits of narcissism as the well-known overt type. The difference is when they control \& manipulate, when they demean \& devalue you, it is done in such a subtle way you don't notice it.
	
	This type of narcissism is 1 of the most damaging forms because the abuse is so hidden \& so insidious. You can be in a relationship with a covert narcissist that can last for decades \& not realize you are being psychologically \& emotionally controlled, manipulated, \& abused. There are no visible scars with this form of abuse, \& you are usually the only one that experiences their destructive \& psychologically debilitating behavior.
	
	{\it Living with a covert narcissist drains your spirit \& leaves you questioning your own reality}.
	
	You have been lied to for years, \& it is time to finally see the truth of what you have been through, who you really are, \& how much you deserve love \& happiness.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item {\it The Covert Passive-Aggressive Narcissist} belongs on passive-aggressive every survivor's bookshelf. {\sc Debbie Mirza}'s book is a compassionate \& healing resource for anyone seeking relief after narcissistic abuse. She clearly identifies subtle red flags that are often so difficult for survivors to pinpoint, while also encouraging the reader to look inward for solutions. Her warm \& encouraging words are like receiving a written hug when you need it most.'' -- {\sc Jackson MacKenzie}, author of {\it Psychopath Free} \& {\it Whole Again}
		\item ``This is an insight book for therapists working with complex trauma \&{\tt/}or Complex-PTSD. Clinicians can diagnose ``textbook'' narcissism. However, covert passive-aggressive narcissism is difficult to identify \& not widely recognized in the field of mental health therapy. {\sc Debbie} shines a light on interpersonal relationships with a CPAN by naming experiences \& behavioral patterns. As a clinical social worker, I love this book \& use it as a basis of understanding clients who have experienced emotional \& psychological abuse by someone they love. Thank you for having the wisdom to write this book \& validate the invisible scars of survivors because this is where healing begins.'' -- {\sc Denise Malm}, LSWAIC, GMHS
		\item ``The Covert Passive-Aggressive Narcissist brings a massive sigh of relief to people who have been involved with, were raised by, or worked with someone who has made them feel crazy, exhausted, depressed, unworthy, guilty, terrified, \& chronically anxious, while they charmed \& amazed others. {\sc Debbie Mirza} provides insight, answers, \& healing to those who have wondered whether they have been abused by a narcissist but have not found themselves or their answers in the current literature on Narcissist Abuse. As a Clinical Psychologist for over 20 years, I find that {\it The Covert Passive-Aggressive Narcissist} fills in the missing pieces in this field for clinicians \& victims alike. {\sc Debbie} clarifies this phenomenon{\tt/}personality disorder when I have struggled to explain it in my own life \& in the stories of countless patients. You aren't crazy: this book helps you identify \& name the abuse -- so you can be free to truly reclaim your life.'' -- {\sc Robin LW Alchin}, PhD, Clinical Psychologist
		\item ``Passive-aggression. Narcissism. These terms are bandied about in 21st-century America, often without a clear definition, \& without understanding how to respond effectively once they are recognized. Enter {\sc Debbie Mirza}, \& her brilliant, immensely helpful book, {\it The Covert Passive-Aggressive Narcissist}. She realized that passive-aggression \& narcissism coexist, that these behaviors are epidemic in our culture \& that millions of people are guilty of them. She realized it because she herself was once the target of a Covert Passive-Aggressive Narcissist (CN). After finding her way out, she used her experience to write her book, \&, in so doing, she is helping other targets to escape from their base relationships. Chap. 3 uniquely describes those who are likely to be victimized by CNs: empathic, compassionate, nurturing, trusting, dependable, flexible -- all the positive traits of beautiful human beings. Their task is to realize their sense of self-worth in order to extricate themselves from the grip of the Ctextbook \& to find peace. The book offers multiple strategies for doing so, including a checklist of {\it Traits of Real Love}, so that the survivor recognizes it when it is found. It is a book to be read \& re-read by clients \& therapists alike, as it is an important contribution to self-help literature.'' -- {\sc Judy M. Sobczak}, Ph.D., Licensed Psychologist
		\item ``As a psychotherapist, this book has proven to be an outstanding, effective tool to help clients in these types of relationships be able to finally understand \& clearly know what they are dealing with. The author does an excellent job of clearly identifying \& providing a name to all the ``crazy-making'' behaviors the covert passive-aggressive narcissist does in order to make my clients feel like they are never enough. It identifies those gaslighting behaviors, dissects, \& defines them 1 by 1, in a clear, concise way with lots of real-life examples. Before I read this book, I didn't have the words to describe a dysfunctional relationship of this sort. Now I do $\ldots$ \& it has made a world of difference to my clients by not only improving their lives but also eliminating depression \& anxiety symptoms which were a result of the covert passive aggressive narcissist's behaviors.'' -- {\sc Pam Hauke}, MSW, LCSW, SAC

	{\sf From the Author.} ``Dear Reader, Writing this book was a passion project for me. I had you in mind with every word. I wrote this book so you could have the answers you have been looking for, the clarity you deserve. If you have come to this book, I imagine you are probably in a relationship, or coming out of one that has been incredibly confusing \& hurtful. You have most likely thought the issues in the relationship were your fault. You have either been told this by your partner, parent, friend, sibling, or co-worker, or given this message through subtle means. You may be questioning your own reality \& are filled with self-doubt. Your physical health has been affected. The light inside you has dimmed. This person you have experienced is probably well liked, which makes this even more confusing. They may even do things to help others or are in a profession where they are revered. They could even be looked up to as a guru, a therapist, a pastor, a leader of some kind. They are probably successful, charming, \& appear sincere. I know what it is like to be utterly confused by a relationship with someone you love deeply \& honestly. I know what it is like to have the life inside you slowly drain away until you are an exhausted version of yourself with low self-esteem \& little self-confidence. Covert narcissism is the most confusing \& crazy making type of narcissism. These people have the same traits as the well-known overt narcissist, but the way they manifest is very different. You can live with a covert narcissist for years \& not see through their behavior. Years ago, I searched for answers to help with my own confusion. I read many books on narcissism but could not find any on the covert type. After years of piecing together information from various sources, I decided to write the book I had needed \& couldn't find so other survivors, like you, would have the information that would help you heal, all in 1 place. In preparation for this book, I interviewed $> 100$ survivors. I also spoke with therapists in this field. I did in-depth research on the topic because I wanted to make sure this book would be accurate, comprehensive, \& incredibly helpful for you. You deserve that. As I met more \& more people who have experienced this type of relationship, my heart was affected tremendously. Witnessing their pain, their wounded hearts, \& their strength was humbling \& brought out a fierceness in me that made me want to make this the most helpful book I possibly could. In this book, I explain the traits of a covert narcissist. I share lots of stories from people I've interviewed to illustrate the traits. I also spend a lot of time talking about healing. If you have read this far, my hunch is you have probably been through or are going through a tremendously difficult \& crazy-making experience with a covert narcissist. You deserve to find clarity \& ultimately heal the wounds this relationship has caused. I go into further depth of how to heal in another book I wrote called, {\it The Safest Place Possible}, where I share some of my own personal stories \& the process I went through to heal. Being with a covert narcissist can take you far away from the person you really are. My hope is this book will help bring you back to your stunning self. May you find all the answers you are looking for \& come to a place of freedom \& peace. That may not feel possible right now, but trust me, it is. With love, {\sc Debbie Mirza}

	{\sf Amazon review.} {\it The Noonday Demon} is {\sc Andrew Solomon}'s National Book Award-winning, bestselling, \& transformative masterpiece on depression -- ``the book for a generation, elegantly written, meticulously researched, empathetic, \& enlightening'' ({\it Time}) -- now with a major new chapter covering recently introduced \& novel treatments, suicide \& anti-depressants, pregnancy \& depression, \& much more.
	
	{\it The Noonday Demon} examines depression in personal, cultural, \& scientific terms. Drawing on his own struggles with the illness \& interviews with fellow sufferers, doctors, \& scientists, policy makers \& politicians, drug designers, \& philosophers, {\sc Andrew Solomon} reveals the subtle complexities \& sheer agony of the disease as well as the reasons for hope. He confronts the challenge of defining the illness \& describes the vast range of available medications \& treatments, \& the impact the malady has on various demographic populations -- around the world \& throughout history. He also explores the thorny patch of moral \& ethical questions posed by biological explanations for mental illness. With uncommon humanity, candor, with, \& erudition, award-winning author {\sc Solomon} takes readers on a journey of incomparable range \& resonance into the most pervasive of family secrets. His contribution to our understanding not only of mental illness but also of the human condition is truly stunning.''
	
	{\sf Editorial Reviews.}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ``All encompassing, brave, \& deeply humane $\ldots$ It is open-minded, critically informed, \& poetic at the same time, \& despite the nature of its subject it is written with far too much \'elan \& elegance ever to become depressing itself.'' -- {\sc Richard Bernstein}, {\it The New York Times}
		\item ``{\it The Noonday Demon} is the ideal \& definitive book on depression. There is nothing falsely consoling about this account, which is the opposite of a bromide\footnote{a chemical which contains bromine, used, especially in the past, to make people feel calm.}, unless to be accompanied by so much intelligence \& understanding is a consolation in itself.'' -- {\sc Edmund White}, author of {\it A Boy's Own Story \& The Flaneur		}
		\item ``An exhaustively researched, provocative, \& often deeply moving survey of depression $\ldots$ original \& vividly recounted, {\sc Solomon} writes engagingly; his style is intimate \& anecdotal $\ldots$ witty \& persuasive. Overall $\ldots$ {\it The Noonday Demon} is a considerable accomplishment. It is likely to provoke discussion \& controversy, \& its generous assortment of voices, from the pathological to the philosophical, makes for rich, variegated reading.'' -- {\sc Joyce Carol Oates}, {\it The New York Times Book Review}
		\item ``The book for a generation $\ldots$ Solomon interweaves\footnote{to twist together 2 or more pieces of thread, wool, etc.} a personal narrative with scientific, philosophical, historical, political, \& cultural insights. $\ldots$ The result is an elegantly written, meticulously researched book that is empathetic \& enlightening, scholarly \& useful $\ldots$ Solomon apologizes that `no book can span the reach of human suffering.' This one comes close.'' -- {\sc Christine Whitehouse}. {\it Time}
		\item ``Both heartrending \& fascinating $\ldots$ the book has a scope \& passionate intelligence that gives it intrigue as well as heft.'' -- {\sc Gail Caldwell}, {\it The Boston Globe}
		\item ``{\it The Noonday Demon} explores the subterranean\footnote{under the ground.} realms of an illness which is on the point of becoming endemic, \& which more than anything else mirrors the present state of our civilization \& its profound discontents. As wide-ranging as it is incisive, this astonishing work is a testimony both to the muted suffering of millions \& to the great courage it must have taken the author to set his mind against it.'' -- {\sc W. G. Emily Nussbaum}, {\it The Village Voice}
		\item ``A wrenching candid, fascinating, \& exhaustive tour of 1 of the darker chambers of the human heart.'' -- {\sc Daniel Goleman}, author of {\it Emotional Intelligence}
		\item ``Everyone will find a piece of himself in Solomon's account, even if he has been spared the experience of watching that kernel blossom into a monstrous \& strangling plant $\ldots$ Solomon shows bravery \& rigor.'' -- {\sc Christopher Caldwell}, {\it Slate magazine}
		\item ``Exhaustive \& eloquent\footnote{1. able to use language \& express your opinions well, especially when you are speaking in public; 2. (of a look or movement) able to express a feeling. có tài hùng biện.}.'' -- {\sc Maria Russo}, Salon.com
		\item ``{\it The Noonday Demon} is an amazingly rich \& absorbing work that deals with depression on many levels of perception. In its flow of insights \& its scope -- encompassing not only the author's own ordeal but also keen inquiries into the biological, social, \& political aspects of the illness -- {\it The Noonday Demon} has achieved a level of authority that should assure its place among the few indispensable works on depression.'' -- {\sc William Styron}, author of {\it Darkness Visible}
		\item ``{\sc Andrew Solomon}'s {\it The Noonday Demon} is immensely readable \& should be universally useful. It is indeed an atlas of depression, sensitively chronicling the illness's characteristics, social \& cultural history, modes of treatment, \& prospects. What makes it remarkable is a highly individual blend of the personal \& the dispassionate, the work of a benign intelligence.'' -- {\sc Harold Bloom}, author of {\it How to Read \& Why \& Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human}
		\item ``Frank $\ldots$ clearheaded [\&] valuable $\ldots$'' -- {\it Entertainment Weekly}
		\item ``Compulsively readable, harrowing, \& helpful, {\it The Noonday Demon} is an act of redemption in an epidemic of sorrow.'' -- {\sc Louise Erdrich}, author of {\it Love Medicine \& The Antelope Wife}
		\item ``{\sc Solomon}'s done his homework $\ldots$ smart, lucid, \& sometimes intensely moving.'' -- {\sc David Gate}, {\it Newsweek}
		\item ``As the great Flaubert discovered, it's hard to write about boring people without being boring yourself. Similarly, it's hard to write at length about depression without depressing the reader. Yet in {\it The Noonday Demon}, {\sc Andrew Solomon}, through his candor, intellectual elegance, \& ultimately his human resilience, manages to write of traumas both deep \& ordinary without leaving the reader traumatized. His book is a large achievement.'' -- {\sc Larry McMurtry}, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of {\it Lonesome Dove}
		\item ``{\sc Solomon}'s highly readable, tag-all-bases new book $\ldots$ gives us nothing less than an evolving portrait of who, collectively, we are $\ldots$ ambitious \& broadly synthesizing $\ldots$ [written with] considerable stylistic grace $\ldots$ {\sc Solomon} is knowledgeable, trenchant, \& an admirable distiller of facts \& perspectives.'' -- {\sc Sven Birkerts}, {\it The New York Observer}

	{\sf Amazon review.} Within every community, toxic people can be found hiding in families, couples, companies, \& places of worship.

The stages are Despair, Education, Awakening, Boundaries, Restoration, \& Maintenance. A guided Personal Reflections journal is included in the back of the book to help the reader go deeper in their application of the 6 stages of recovery. The journal can be used individually or in a small group setting.

	{\sf Amazon review.} {\it Exposing Financial Abuse: When Money is a Weapon} is a raw \& shocking expos\'e of economic exploitation \& abuse that occurs within families, the family law courts, among peers, \& places of worship.
	
	Within {\it Exposing Financial Abuse: When Money Is a Weapon}, you will be given the opportunity to pull the curtain back \& see into the lives of those who have been financially harmed by someone close to them. Taking a closer look at this hidden world is a unique gift that cannot be taken lightly or without honor for those who have chosen to allow us to peek into the most personal aspects of their lives.
	
	Test yourself. How would you describe financial abuse? It is quietly happening all around us \& is hidden within our neighborhoods \& communities. You probably know someone who lives within a financially abusive household, \& you don't even know it.
	
	What is financial abuse? Has your spouse or parent taken out lines of credit in your name without your consent? Does your ex-spouse suddenly stop paying child support as a means of furthering their abuse \& control over your life? Has your partner moved money from your joint account to a secret individual account without your prior knowledge or consent? Do your parents use financial gifts as an open door to demand future compliance on your part? Are you blamed for creating financial stress but are not the one who overspends? Did your ex-spouse hide his or her income from being included in the calculations for child \&{\tt/}or spousal support? Have your religious leaders said that you must give to the church 1st, even if that means you cannot provide for your household's basic needs? Do you carry the full burden of making enough money for your household because your partner refuses to maintain steady employment?

	{\sf Editorial Reviews.}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ``Perhaps what makes {\sc Pema}'s message resonate so strongly with people, no matter what their religion or spiritual path, is its universality. Each of us has experienced heartache; how we interact with that feeling, {\sc Pema} says, can create the possibility of a more joyful life.'' -- {\it O, The Oprah Magazine}
		\item ``If you're facing a challenging time in life, this is the book you want. It shows how to develop loving-kindness toward yourself \& then cultivate a fearlessly compassionate attitude toward your own pain \& that of others.'' -- {\it Lion's Roar}
		\item ``{\sc Pema Ch\"odr\"on} is 1 of those spiritual teachers who brings ancient wisdom to bear upon our daily triumphs \& tragedies $\ldots$ Incredibly wise \& poignantly practical.'' -- {\it Spirituality \& Health}
		\item ``{\sc Ch\"odr\"on}'s book is filled with useful advice about how Buddhism helps readers to cope with the grim realities of modern life, including fear, despair, rage, \& the feeling that we are not in control of our lives $\ldots$ {\sc Ch\"odr\"on} demonstrates how effective the Buddhist point of view can be in bringing order into disordered lives.'' -- {\it Publishers Weekly}
		\item ``This is a book that could serve you for a lifetime.'' -- {\it Natural Health}

Through the course of this book, readers will learn practical methods for heightening awareness \& overcoming habitual patterns that block compassion.

	{\sf Amazon review.} Lifelong guidance for learning to change the way we relate to the scary \& difficult moments of our lives, showing us how we can use all of our difficulties \& fears as a way to soften our hearts \& open us to greater kindness.
	
	We always have a choice in how we react to the circumstances of our lives. We can let them harden us \& make us increasingly resentful \& afraid, or we can let them soften us \& allow our inherent human kindness to shine through. Here {\sc Pema Ch\"odr\"on} provides essential tools for dealing with the many difficulties that life throws our way, teaching us how to awaken our basic human goodness \& connect deeply with others -- to accept ourselves \& everything around us complete with faults \& imperfections. She shows the strength that comes from staying in touch with what's happening in our lives right now \& helps us unmask the ways in which our egos cause us to resist life as it is. If we go to the places that scare us, {\sc Pema} suggests, we just might find the boundless life we're always dreamed of.

	This seminal book, which has been called ``1 of the outstanding contributions to psychological thought'' by {\sc Carl Rogers} \& ``1 of the great books of our time'' by {\sc Harold Kushner}, has been translated into $> 50$ languages \& sold over $16\cdot10^6$ copies. ``An enduring work of survival literature,'' according to the {\it New York Times}, {\sc Viktor Frankl}'s riveting\footnote{so interesting or exciting that it holds your attention completely. $=$ {\it engrossing}.} account of his time in the Nazi concentration camps, \& his insightful exploration of the human will to find meaning in spite of the worst adversity, has offered solace\footnote{{\it solace somebody} to make somebody feel better or happier when they are sad or disappointed, $=$ {\it comfort}.} \& guidance to generations of readers since it was 1st published in 1946. At the heart of {\sc Frankl}'s theory of logotherapy (from the Greek word for ``meaning'') is a conviction that the primary human drive is not pleasure, as {\sc Freud} maintained, but rather the discovery \& pursuit of what the individual finds meaningful. Today, as new generations face new challenges \& an ever more complex \& uncertain world, {\sc Frankl}'s classic work continues to inspire us all to find significance in the very act of living, in spite of all obstacles.

	{\sf Amazon review.} What does everyone in the modern world need to know? Renowned psychologist {\sc Jordan B. Peterson}'s answer to this most difficult of questions uniquely combines the hard-won truths of ancient tradition with the stunning revelations of cutting-edge scientific research.
	
	Humorous, surprising, \& informative, Dr. {\sc Peterson} tells us why skateboarding boys \& girls must be left alone, what terrible fate awaits those who criticize too easily, \& why you should always pet a cat when you meet one on the street.
	
	What does the nervous system of the lowly lobster have to tell us about standing up straight (with our shoulders back) \& about success in life? Why did ancient Egyptians worship the capacity to pay careful attention as the highest of gods? What dreadful paths do people tread when they become resentful, arrogant, \& vengeful?
	
	Dr. {\sc Peterson} journeys broadly, discussing discipline, freedom, adventure, \& responsibility, distilling the world's wisdom into 12 practical \& profound rules for life. {\it12 Rules for Life} shatters the modern commonplaces of science, faith, \& human nature, while transforming \& ennobling the mind \& spirit of its readers.

		\item ``{\sc Jordan Peterson}, has become 1 of the best-known Canadians of this generation. In the intellectual category, he's easily the largest international phenomenon since {\sc Marshall McLuhan} $\ldots$ By combining knowledge of the past with a full-hearted optimism \& a generous attitude toward his readers \& listeners, {\sc Peterson} generates an impressive level of intellectual firepower.'' -- {\sc Robert Fulford}, {\it National Post}
		\item ``Like the best intellectual polymaths, {\sc Peterson} invites his readers to embark on their own intellectual, spiritual, \& ideological journeys into the many topics \& disciplines he touches on. It's a counter-intuitive strategy for a population hooked on the instant gratification of ideological comformity \& social media `likes', but if {\sc Peterson} is right, you have nothing to lose but your own misery.'' -- {\it Toronto Star}
		\item ``In a different intellectual league $\ldots$ {\sc Peterson} can make the most difficult ideas \& make them entertaining. This may be why his YouTube videos have had $35\cdot10^6$ views. He is fast becoming the closest that academia has to a rock star.'' -- {\it The Observer}
		\item ``Grow up \& man up is the message from this rock-star psychologist $\ldots$ [A] hardline self-helf manual of self-reliance, good behavior, self-betterment \& individualism that probably reflects his childhood in rural Canada in the 1960s. As with all self-help manuals, there's always a \fbox{kernel of truth}. Formerly a Harvard professor, now at the University of Toronto, {\sc Peterson} retains that whiff of cowboy philosophy -- 1 essay is a homily on doing 1 thing every day to improve yourself. Another, on bringing up little children to behave, is excellent $\ldots$ [{\sc Peterson}] twirls ideas around like a magician.'' -- {\sc Melanie Reid}, {\it The Times}
		\item ``You don't have to agree with [{\sc Peterson}'s politics] to like this book for, once you discard the self-help label, it becomes fascinating. {\sc Peterson} is brilliant on many subjects $\ldots$ So what we have here is a baggy, aggressive, in-your-face, get-real book that, ultimately, is an attempt to lead us back to what {\sc Peterson} sees as the true, the beautiful, \& the good -- i.e., God. In the highest possible sense of the term, I suppose it is a self-help book $\ldots$ Either way, it's a rocky read, but nobody ever said God was easy.'' -- {\sc Bryan Appleyard}, {\it The Times}

		\item ``Someone with not only humanity \& humor, but serious depth \& substance $\ldots$ {\sc Peterson} has a truly cosmopolitan \& omnivorous intellect, but one that recognizes that things need grounding in a home if they are ever going to be meaningful grasped $\ldots$ As well as being funny, there is a burning sincerity to the man which only the most withered cynic could suspect.'' -- {\it The Spectator}

	{\sf Amazon review.} The companion volume to {\it12 Rules for Life} offers further guidance on the perilous path of modern life.
	
	In {\it12 Rules for Life}, clinical psychologist \& celebrated professor at Harvard \& University of Toronto Dr. {\sc Jordan B. Peterson} helped millions of readers impose order on the chaos of their lives. Now, in this hold sequel, {\sc Peterson} delivers 12 more lifesaving principles for resisting the exhausting toll that our desire to order the world inevitably takes.
	
	In a time when the human will increasingly imposes itself over every sphere of life -- from our social structures to our emotional states -- {\sc Peterson} warns that too much security is dangerous. What's more, he offers strategies for overcoming the cultural, scientific, \& psychological fores causing us to tend toward tyranny, \& teaches us how to rely instead on our instinct to find meaning \& purpose, even-- \& especially -- when we find ourselves powerless.
	
	While chaos, in excess, threatens us with instability \& anxiety, unchecked order can petrify us into submission. {\it Beyond Order} provides a call to balance these 2 fundamental principles of reality itself, \& guides us along the straight \& narrow path that divides them.

	{\sf Amazon review.} Why have people from different cultures \& eras formulated myths \& stories with similar structures? What does this similarity tell us about the mind, morality, \& structure of the world itself? From the author of {\it12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos} comes a provocative hypothesis that explores the connection between what modern neuropsychology tells us about the brain \& what rituals, myths, \& religious stories have long narrated. A cutting-edge work that brings together neuropsychology, cognitive science, \& Freudian \& Jungian approaches to mythology \& narrative, {\it Maps of Meaning} presents a rich theory that makes the wisdom \& meaning of myth accessible to the critical modern mind.
	
	{\sf Editorial Reviews.}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ``The book reflects its author's profound moral sense \& vast erudition in areas ranging from clinical psychology to scripture \& a good deal of personal soul-searching \& experience $\ldots$ with patients who include prisoners, alcoholics, \& the mentally ill.'' -- {\it Montreal Gazette}
		\item ``This is not a book to be abstracted \& summarized. Rather it should be read at leisure $\ldots$ \& employed as a stimulus \& reference to expand one's own maps of meaning. I plan to return to {\sc Peterson}'s musings \& mapping many times over the next few years.'' -- {\it Am JPsychiatry}

	\end{itemize}
	{\sf From Inside Flap.} Why would people in different places \& times formulate myths \& stories with similar symbols \& meanings? Are groups of people with different religious or ideological beliefs doomed to eternal conflict? Are the claims of science \& religion truly irreconcilable? What might be done to decrease the individual propensity for group-fostered cruelty? {\it Maps of Meaning} addresses these questions with a provocative new hypothesis that explores the connection between what modern neuropsychology tells us about the brain \& what rituals, myths, \& religious stories have long narrated. {\sc Peterson}'s ambitious interdisciplinary odyssey draws insights from the worlds of religion, cognitive science, \& Jungian approaches to mythology \& narrative. {\it Maps of Meaning} offers a critical guide to the riches of archaic \& modern thought \& invaluable insights into human motivation \& cognition.
	
	{\sf From Back Cover.} ``{\sc Jordan Peterson}'s book is a brilliant enlargement of our understanding of human motivation. He follows a path that has been recommended by many scientist-scholars in the past -- but one that is, in practice, so extraordinarily demanding that it is hardly ever done well. {\sc Peterson} synthesizes research \& scholarly literatures ranging from neuroscience to archaeology. He aligns finds of those literatures with the writings of such authors as {\sc Jung, Nietzsche, Dostoevsky, \& Solzhenitsyn}. There is loving detail in this book -- reflection, thoughtfulness, careful study, a passionate desire to understand. This is a beautiful work.'' -- {\sc Sheldon H.

		\item ``This book is a journey unfolding our minds to have clarity \& understanding, knowing what is \& not what if, as the mind cast an illusion in our daily lives to sieve out thoughts \& thinking \& to know the difference. I enjoyed the explanations given for each chapters \& it's raise your awareness \& expand your consciousness to bring you to a state of non-thinking where you actually feel joy, peace, \& harmony within. It is not easy to stay in the state of non-thinking but the guides given by the author does help to center your thoughts not your thinking to be in the state of non-thinking. This book has help me to understand myself better \& a journey of discovery for me. I think the author for such an amazing work, simple, \& profound. I like the part how the mind thinks \& says it is not possible or the guides given are to simple \& will not work out for me but when I deep dive within, accepting my negative thinking \& acknowledging it, makes a lot of difference in fighting it or resisting it. I recommend anyone who is on the journey of self discovery \& how to deal with your mind, this is the book for you.'' -- {\sc Jay R.}
