I love writing.

I prefer writing by LaTeX & then uploaded TeX files and their PDFs to my GitHub repository over writing directly in HTML (blogging in its original definition).

Reason: The former can be saved locally and reuploaded & LaTeX offers various adjustments, meanwhile the latter can be easily destroyed if some shits happen with the blog platform.
