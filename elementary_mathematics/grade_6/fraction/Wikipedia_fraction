\section{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction}{Wikipedia\texttt{/}Fraction}}
``A \textit{fraction} (from Latin: \textit{fractus}, ``broken'') represents a part of a whole or, more generally, any number of equal parts. When spoken in everyday English, a fraction describes how many parts of a certain size there are, e.g., one-half $\frac{1}{2}$, eight-fifths $\frac{8}{5}$, three-quarters $\frac{3}{4}$. A \textit{common, vulgar}, or \textit{simple} fraction (e.g., $\frac{1}{2},\frac{17}{3}$) consists of a \textit{numerator}, displayed above a line (or before a slash like 1\texttt{/}2), \& a nonzero \textit{denominator}, displayed below (or after) that line. Numerators \& denominators are also used in fractions that are not \textit{common}, including compound fractions, complex fractions, \& mixed numerals.

In positive common fractions, the numerator \& denominator are \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number}{natural numbers}, i.e., $\frac{a}{b} > 0$, with $a,b\in\mathbb{N}$, $b\ne0$. The numerator represents a number of equal parts, \& the denominator indicates how many of those parts make up a unit or a whole. The denominator cannot be zero, because zero parts can never make up a whole. E.g., in the fraction $\frac{3}{4}$, the numerator 3 indicates that the fraction represents 3 equal parts, \& the denominator 4 indicates that 4 parts make up a whole.

A common fraction is a numeral which represents a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number}{rational number} $r\in\mathbb{Q}$. That same number can also be represented as a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal}{decimal}, a percent, or with a negative \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation}{exponent}. E.g., $0.01$, 1\%, \& $10^{-2}$ are all equal to the fraction $\frac{1}{100}$. An \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer}{integer} can be thought of as having an implicit denominator of 1 (e.g., $7 = \frac{7}{1}$).

Other uses for fractions are to represent \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio}{ratios} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_(mathematics)}{division}. Thus the fraction $\frac{3}{4}$ can also be used to represent the ratio 3:4 (the ratio of the part to the whole), \& the division $3\div4$ (3 divided by 4). The nonzero denominator rule, which applies when representing a division as a fraction, is an example of the rule that \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_by_zero}{division by zero} is undefined.

We can also write negative fractions, which represent the opposite of a positive fraction. E.g., if $\frac{1}{2}$ represents a half-dollar profit, then $-\frac{1}{2}$ represents a half-dollar loss. Because of the rules of division of signed numbers (which states in part that negative divided by positive is negative), $-\frac{1}{2},\frac{-1}{2}$, \& $\frac{1}{-2}$ all represent the same fraction -- negative one-half. \& because a negative divided by a negative produces a positive, $\frac{-1}{-2}$ represents positive one-half.

In mathematics the set of all numbers that can be expressed in the form $\frac{a}{b}$, where $a,b\in\mathbb{Z}$, $b\ne0$, is called the set of rational numbers \& is represented by the symbol $\mathbb{Q}$, which stands for \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient}{quotient}. A number is a rational number precisely when it can be written in that form (i.e., as a common fraction). However, the word \textit{fraction} can also be used to describe mathematical expressions that are not rational numbers. Examples of these usages include \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_fraction}{algebraic fractions} (quotients of algebraic expressions), \& expressions that contain \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number}{irrational numbers}, e.g., $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ (see \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root_of_2}{square root of 2}) \& $\frac{\pi}{4}$ (se \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_that_%CF%80_is_irrational}{proof that $\pi$ is irrational}).'' -- \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction}{Wikipedia\texttt{/}fraction}

In a fraction, the number of equal parts being described is the \textit{numerator} (from Latin: \textit{numerātor}, ``counter'' or ``numberer''), \& the type or variety of the parts is the \textit{denominator} (from Latin: \textit{dēnōminātor}, ``thing that names or designates''). E.g., the fraction $\frac{8}{5}$ amounts of 8 parts, each of which is of the type named ``fifth''. In terms of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_(math)}{division}, the numerator corresponds to the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_(math)}{dividend}, \& the denominator corresponds to the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_(math)}{divisor}.

Informally, the numerator \& denominator may be distinguished by placement alone, but in formal contexts they are usually separated by a \textit{fraction bar}. The fraction bar may be horizontal (as in $\frac{1}{3}$), oblique (as in $2/5$), or diagonal (as in $\sfrac{4}{9}$). These marks are respectively known as the horizontal bar; the virgule, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_mark}{slash} (US), or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_stroke}{stroke} (UK); \& the fraction bar, solidus, or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_slash}{fraction slash}.
