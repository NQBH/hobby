\chapter{Jordan B. Peterson. \textit{12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos}}

\section*{Introduction}
``\textit{12 Rules for Life: An Antidote\footnote{\textbf{antidote} [n] \textbf{1.} \textbf{antidote (to something)} a substance that controls the effects of a poison or disease; \textbf{2.} \textbf{antidote (to something)} anything that takes away the effects of something unpleasant.} to Chaos\footnote{\textbf{chaos} [n] [uncountable] a state of complete confusion \& lack of order; in physics, \textbf{chaos} is the property of a complex system whose behavior is so unpredictable that it appears random, especially because small changes in conditions can have very large effects; \textbf{chaos theory} is the branch of mathematics that deals with these complex systems.}} is a 2018 \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-help_book}{self-help book} by the Canadian clinical\footnote{\textbf{clinical} [a] [only before noun] connected with the examination \& treatment of patients \& their illnesses.} psychologist\footnote{\textbf{psychologist} [n] a scientist who studies psychology.} \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Peterson}{Jordan Peterson}. It provides life advice through essays in abstract ethical\footnote{\textbf{ethical} [a] \textbf{1.} connected with beliefs \& principles about what is right \& wrong; \textbf{2.} morally correct or acceptable.} principles, psychology, mythology\footnote{\textbf{mythology} [n] [uncountable, countable] \textbf{1.} ancient myths in general; the ancient myths of a particular culture, society, etc.; \textbf{2.} \textbf{mythology (of something)} ideas that many people think are true but are in fact false.}, religion\footnote{\textbf{religion} [n] \textbf{1.} [uncountable] the belief in the existence of a god or gods, \& the activities that are connected with the worship of them; \textbf{2.} [countable] 1 of the systems of belief that are based on the belief in the existence of a particular god or gods.}, \& personal anecdotes\footnote{\textbf{anecdote} [n] [countable, uncountable] \textbf{1.} \textbf{anecdote (about somebody\texttt{/}something)} a short, interesting or funny story about a real person or event; \textbf{2.} a personal account of an event, especially one that is considered as possibly not true or accurate.}.''[$\ldots$] ``The book is written in a more accessible style than his previous academic book, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maps_of_Meaning:_The_Architecture_of_Belief}{Maps of Meaning: The Artchitecture of Belief} (1999).

\subsection*{Overview}

\paragraph*{Background.} ``Peterson's interest in writing the book grew out of a personal hobby of answering questions posted on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quora}{Quora}; 1 such question being
\begin{question}
	\fbox{``What are the most valuable things everyone should know?'',}
\end{question}
to which his answer comprised 42 rules. The early vision \& promotion of the book aimed to include all rules, with the title ``42''. Peterson stated that it ``isn't only written for other people. It's warning to me.'''' -- \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_Rules_for_Life#Background}{Wikipedia\texttt{/}12 Rules for Life\texttt{/}overview\texttt{/}background}

\paragraph*{12 Rules.} ``The book is divided into chapters with each title representing 1 of the following 12 specific rules for life as explained through an essay.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item ``Stand up straight with your shoulders back.''
	\item ``Treat yourself like you are someone you are responsible for helping.''
	\item ``Make friends with people who want the best for you.''
	\item ``Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today.''
	\item ``Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them.''
	\item ``Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world.''
	\item ``Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient\footnote{\textbf{expedient} [n] an action that is useful or necessary for a particular purpose, but not always fair or right.}).''
	\item ``Tell the truth -- or, at least, don't lie.''
	\item ``Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don't.''
	\item ``Be precise in your speech.''
	\item ``Do not bother children when they are skate-boarding.''
	\item ``Pet a cat when you encounter\footnote{\textbf{encounter} [v] \textbf{1.} \textbf{encounter something} to experience something, especially something unpleasant or difficult, while you are trying to do something else, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{run into something}; \textbf{2.} \textbf{encounter something\texttt{/}somebody} to discover or experience something, or meet somebody, especially something\texttt{/}somebody new, unusual or unexpected, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{come across somebody\texttt{/}something}; [n] a meeting, especially one that is sudden or unexpected.} one on the street.'''' -- \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_Rules_for_Life#12_Rules}{Wikipedia\texttt{/}12 Rules for Life\texttt{/}overview\texttt{/}content}
\end{enumerate} 

\paragraph*{Content.} ``The book's central idea is that ``\fbox{suffering is built into the structure of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being}{being}}'' \& although it can be unbearable\footnote{\textbf{unbearable} [a] too painful, annoying or unpleasant to deal with or accept, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{intolerable}, \textsc{opposite}: \textbf{bearable}.}, people have a choice either to withdraw\footnote{\textbf{withdraw} [v] \textbf{1.} [transitive, intransitive] (used especially about armed forces) to make people leave a place; to leave a place; \textbf{2.} [intransitive] \textbf{withdraw (to something)} to leave a room; to go away from other people; \textbf{3.} [transitive] to move something back, out or away from something; \textbf{4.} [transitive] to take money out of a bank account or financial institution; \textbf{5.} [intransitive] to stop taking part in something; \textbf{6.} [intransitive] to stop wanting to speak to, or be with, other people; \textbf{7.} [transitive] to no longer provide or offer something; to no longer make something available; \textbf{8.} [transitive] \textbf{withdraw something} to say that you no longer agree with what you said before.}, which is a ``suicidal\footnote{\textbf{suicidal} [a] (of people) very unhappy or depressed \& feeling that they want to kill themselves; (of behavior) showing this.} gesture\footnote{\textbf{gesture} [n] \textbf{1.} [countable, uncountable] \textbf{gesture (of something)} something that you do or say to show a particular feeling or intention; \textbf{2.} [countable, uncountable] a movement that you make with your hands, your head or your face to show a particular meaning.}'', or to face \& transcend\footnote{\textbf{transcend} [v] \textbf{transcend something} to be or go beyond the usual limits of something.} it. Living in a world of chaos \& order,\fbox{ everyone has ``darkness''} that can \fbox{``turn them into the monsters they're capable of being''} to satisfy their \fbox{dark impulses\footnote{\textbf{impulse} [n] \textbf{1.} [countable, usually singular, uncountable] a sudden strong wish or need to do something, without stopping to think about the results; \textbf{2.} [countable, usually singular] something that causes somebody\texttt{/}something to do something or to develop \& make progress; \textbf{3.} [countable] a brief electric current, e.g. one that travels from a nerve to a muscle; \textbf{4.} [countable] (\textit{physics}) the change in momentum of an object due to a force.} in the right situations}. Scientific experiments like the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inattentional_blindness#Invisible_Gorilla_Test}{Invisible Gorilla Test} show that perception\footnote{\textbf{perception} [n] \textbf{1.} [uncountable, countable] an idea, a belief or an image you have as a result of how you see or understand something; \textbf{2.} [uncountable] the way you notice things or the ability to notice things with the senses; in biology, \textbf{perception} refers to the processes in the nervous system by which a living thing becomes aware of events \& things outside itself; \textbf{3.} [uncountable] the ability to understand the true nature of something, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{insight}.} is adjusted to aims, \& it is \fbox{better to seek \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_(psychology)}{meaning} rather than happiness}. Peterson notes:
\begin{quotation}
	``It's all very well to think the meaning of life is happiness, but what happens when you're unhappy? Happiness is a great side effect. When it comes, accept it gratefully\footnote{\textbf{grateful} [a] \textbf{1.} feeling or showing thanks because somebody has done something kind for you or has done as you asked; \textbf{2.} used to make a request, especially in a letter or in a formal situation.}. But it's fleeting\footnote{\textbf{fleeting} [a] [usually before noun] lasting only a short time, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{brief}.} \& unpredictable\footnote{\textbf{unpredictable} [a] that cannot be predicted because it changes a lot or depends on too many different things, \textsc{opposite}: \textbf{predictable}.}. It's not something to aim at -- because it's not an aim. \& if happiness is the purpose of life, what happens when you're unhappy? Then you're a failure.''
\end{quotation}
The book advances the idea that \fbox{people are born with an instinct\footnote{\textbf{instinct} [n] [uncountable, countable] a natural tendency for people \& animals to behave in a particular way, using the knowledge \& abilities that they were born with rather than thought or training.} for ethics \& meaning}, \& should take responsibility\footnote{\textbf{responsibility} [n] \textbf{1.} [uncountable, countable] a duty to deal with or take care of somebody\texttt{/}something, so that you may be blamed if something goes wrong; \textbf{2.} [uncountable] \textbf{responsibility (for something)} blame for something bad that has happened; \textbf{3.} [countable, uncountable] a moral duty to behave well with regard to somebody\texttt{/}something.} to search for meaning above their own interests (Rule 7, ``Pursue what is meaningful, not what is expedient''). Such thinking is reflected both in contemporary\footnote{\textbf{contemporary} [a] \textbf{1.} belonging to the present time, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{modern}; \textbf{2.} (especially of people \& society) belonging to the same time as somebody\texttt{/}something else; [n] a person or thing living or existing at the same time as somebody\texttt{/}something else, especially somebody who is about the same age as somebody else.} stories e.g. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinocchio_(1940_film)}{Pinocchio}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion_King}{The Lion King}, \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter}{Harry Potter}, \& in ancient stories from the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible}{Bible}. To ``stand up straight with your shoulders back'' (Rule 1) is to ``accept the terrible responsibility of life'', to make self-sacrifice\footnote{\textbf{self-sacrifice} [n] [uncountable] (\textit{approving}) the act of not allowing yourself to have or do something in order to help other people.}, because the individual must rise above \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victimisation}{victimization}\footnote{\textbf{victimize} [v] [often passive] \textbf{victimize somebody} to make somebody suffer unfairly because you do not like them, their opinions or something that they have done.} \& ``conduct his or her life in a manner that requires the rejection\footnote{\textbf{rejection} [n] [uncountable, countable] \textbf{1.} the act of refusing to accept or consider something; \textbf{2.} the act of refusing to accept somebody for a job or position; \textbf{3.} the decision not to use, sell, publish, etc. something because its quality is not good enough; \textbf{4.} \textbf{rejection (of something)} an occasion when somebody's body does not accept a new organ after a transplant operation, by producing substances that attack the organ; \textbf{5.} the act of failing to give a person or an animal enough care or affection.} of immediate gratification\footnote{\textbf{gratification} [n] [uncountable, countable] (\textit{formal}) the state of feeling pleasure when something goes well for you or when your desires are satisfied; something that gives you pleasure, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{satisfaction}.}, of natural \& perverse\footnote{\textbf{perverse} [a] showing a deliberate \& determined desire to behave in a way that most people think is wrong, unacceptable or unreasonable.} desires alike.'' The comparison to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology}{neurological}\footnote{\textbf{neurological} [a] relating to nerves or to the science of neurology.} structures \& behavior of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobsters}{lobsters} is used as a natural example to the formation\footnote{\textbf{formation} [n] \textbf{1.} [uncountable] the action of forming something; the process of being formed; \textbf{2.} [countable] a thing that has been formed, especially in a particular place or in a particular way; \textbf{3.} [countable, uncountable] a particular arrangement or pattern of people or things.} of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy}{social hierarchies}\footnote{\textbf{hierarchy} [n] \textbf{1.} [countable, uncountable] a system, especially in a society or an organization, in which people are organized into different levels of importance from highest to lowest; \textbf{2.} [countable] a system that ideas or beliefs can be arranged into.}.

The other parts of the work explore \& criticize the state of young men; the upbringing\footnote{\textbf{upbringing} [n] [singular, uncountable] the way in which a child is cared for \& taught how to behave while it is growing up.} that ignores \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_humans}{sex differences} between boys \& girls (criticism of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overprotective}{over-protection} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_rasa}{tabula rasa} model in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science}{social sciences}); male-female \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship}{interpersonal relationships}; \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_shooting}{school shootings}; religion \& moral \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism}{nihilism}\footnote{\textbf{nihilism} [n] [uncountable] (\textit{philosophy}) the belief that life has no meaning or purpose \& that religious \& moral principles have no value.}; \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativism}{relativism}\footnote{\textbf{relativism} [n] [uncountable] the belief that truth is not always \& generally valid, but can be judged only in relation to other things, e.g. your personal situation.}; \& lack of respect for the values that built \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world}{Western society}.

In the last chapter, Peterson outlines the ways in which one can cope with the most tragic\footnote{\textbf{tragic} [a] \textbf{1.} making you feel very sad, usually because somebody has died or suffered a lot; \textbf{2.} [usually before noun] connected with tragedy ($=$ the style of literature).} events, events that are often \fbox{out of one's control}. In it, he describes his own personal struggle upon discovering that his daughter, Mikhaila, had a rare bone disease. The chapter is a meditation\footnote{\textbf{meditation} [n] \textbf{1.} [uncountable] the practice of thinking deeply, usually in silence, especially for religious reasons or in order to make your mind calm; \textbf{2.} [countable, usually plural] \textbf{meditation (on something)} serious thoughts on a particular subject that somebody writes down or speaks.} on how to maintain\footnote{\textbf{maintain} [v] \textbf{1.} \textbf{maintain something} to cause or enable a condition or situation to continue, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{preserve}; \textbf{2.} \textbf{maintain something} to keep something at the same level or rate; \textbf{3.} to state strongly that something is true, even when some other people may not believe it; \textbf{4.} \textbf{maintain somebody\texttt{/}something} to support somebody\texttt{/}something over a long period of time by providing money, paying for food, etc.; \textbf{5.} \textbf{maintain something} to keep a building, machine, etc. in good condition by checking or repairing it regularly; \textbf{6.} \textbf{maintain a record} to write something down as a record \& keep adding the most recent information, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{keep}.} a watchful\footnote{\textbf{watchful} [a] paying attention to what is happening in case of danger, accidents, etc.} eye on, and cherish\footnote{\textbf{cherish} [v] (\textit{formal}) \textbf{1.} \textbf{cherish somebody\texttt{/}something} to love somebody\texttt{/}something very much \& want to protect them or it; \textbf{2.} \textbf{cherish something} to keep an idea, a hope or a pleasant feeling in your mind for a long time.}, life's small redeemable\footnote{\textbf{redeemable} [a] \textbf{redeemable (against something)} that can be exchanged for money or goods.} qualities (i.e., ``pet a cat when you encounter one''). It also outlines a practical way to deal with hardship\footnote{\textbf{hardship} [n] [uncountable, countable] a situation that is difficult \& unpleasant because you do not have enough money, food, clothes, etc.}: to shorten one's temporal\footnote{\textbf{temporal} [a] \textbf{1.} connected with or limited by time; \textbf{2.} connected with the real physical world, not spiritual matters; \textbf{3.} (\textit{anatomy}) near the temples at the side of the head.} scope of responsibility (e.g., focusing on the next minute rather than the next 3 months).

\section*{Foreword}
``Rules? More rules? Really? Isn't life complicated\footnote{\textbf{complicated} [a] \textbf{1.} made of many different things or parts that are connected; difficult to understand, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{complex}, \textsc{opposite}: \textbf{uncomplicated}; \textbf{2.} (of a medical condition) involving complications, \textsc{opposite}: \textbf{uncomplicated}.} enough, restricting enough, without abstract rules that don't take our unique, individual situations into account? \& given that our brains are plastic\footnote{\textbf{plastic} [n] \textbf{1.} [uncountable, countable, usually plural] a light strong material that is produced by chemical processes \& can be formed into shapes when heated. There are many different types of plastic, used to make different objects \& fabrics; \textbf{2. (plastics)} [uncountable] the science of making plastics; [a] \textbf{1.} made of plastic; \textbf{2.} (of a material or substance) easily formed into different shapes; \textbf{3.} (\textit{biology}) (of a living thing) able to adapt to change or variety in the environment.}, \& all develop differently based on our life experiences, why even expect that a few rules might be helpful to us all?

People don't clamor\footnote{\textbf{clamor} [v] \textbf{1.} [intransitive, transitive] (\textit{formal}) to demand something loudly; \textbf{2.} [intransitive] (of many people) to shout loudly, especially in a confused way; [n] (\textit{formal}) \textbf{1.} [singular] a loud noise, especially on that is made by a lot of people or animals; \textbf{2.} [uncountable, countable] \textbf{clamor (for something)} a demand for something made by a lot of people.} for rules, even in the Bible $\ldots$ as when Moses comes down the mountain, after a long absence\footnote{\textbf{absence} [n] \textbf{1.} [uncountable] the fact of somebody\texttt{/}something not existing or not being available, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{lack}, \textsc{opposite}: \textbf{presence}; \textbf{2.} [uncountable, countable] the fact of somebody being away from a place where they are usually expected to be; the occasion or period of time when somebody is away.}, bearing the tablets\footnote{\textbf{tablet} [n] \textbf{1.} (\textit{especially British English}) a small round solid piece of medicine that you swallow, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{pill}; \textbf{2.} a flat piece of stone, etc. with words or symbols on it; \textbf{3.} (also \textbf{tablet computer}) (\textit{trademark} in the UK) a small, light, flat computer that can be used without a keyboard or mouse, by touching the screen.} inscribed\footnote{\textbf{inscribe} [v] \textbf{1.} [often passive] to write or cut words, your name, etc. onto something; \textbf{2.} [often passive] \textbf{inscribe something $+$ adv.\texttt{/}prep.} to make something present in, on, etc. something.} with 10 commandments\footnote{\textbf{commandment} [n] a law given by God, especially any of \textbf{the Ten Commandments} given to the Jews in the Bible.}, \& finds the Children of Israel in revelry\footnote{\textbf{revelry} [n] [uncountable] noisy fun, usually involving a lot of eating \& drinking, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{festivity, merrymaking}.}. They'd been Pharaoh's slaves \& subject to his tyrannical\footnote{\textbf{tyrannical} [a] using power or authority over people in an unfair \& cruel way.} regulations\footnote{\textbf{regulation} [n] \textbf{1.} [countable, usually plural] an official rule made by a government or some other authority; \textbf{2.} [uncountable] the act of controlling something by means of rules; \textbf{3.} [uncountable] the act of controlling how a machine or system operates or how something behaves.} for 400 years, \& after that Moses subjected them to the harsh\footnote{\textbf{harsh} [a] \textbf{1.} very strict; \textbf{2.} (of weather or living conditions) very difficult \& unpleasant to live in.} desert\footnote{\textbf{desert} [n] [uncountable, countable] a large area of land that has very little water \& very few plants growing on it. Many desert areas are covered by sand; [v] \textbf{1.} [transitive, often passive] \textbf{desert somebody} to leave somebody without help or support, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{abandon}; \textbf{2.} [transitive, often passive] \textbf{desert something} to go away from a place \& leave it empty, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{abandon}; \textbf{3.} [intransitive, transitive] \textbf{desert (something)} to leave the armed forces without permission; \textbf{4.} [transitive] \textbf{desert (something) 9for something} to stop using, buying or supporting something.} wilderness\footnote{\textbf{wilderness} [n] [usually singular] a large area of land that has never been developed or used for growing crops because it is difficult to live there.} for another 40 years, to purify\footnote{\textbf{purify} [v] \textbf{1.} \textbf{purify something} to make something pure by removing anything that is bad, unpleasant or not wanted; \textbf{2.} [often passive] (\textit{specialist}) to separate a pure form of a substance from a mixture that contains it; to remove the impurities from a substance; \textbf{3.} \textbf{purify somebody\texttt{/}yourself} to make somebody\texttt{/}yourself pure by removing evil, especially in a ceremony.} them of their slavishness. Now, free at last, they are unbridled\footnote{\textbf{unbridled} [a] [usually before noun] (\textit{literary}) lacking control \& therefore extreme.}, \& have lost all control as they dance wildly around an idol, a golden calf\footnote{\textbf{calf} [n] \textbf{1.} [countable] the back part of the leg between the ankle \& the knee; \textbf{2.} [countable] a young cow; \textbf{3.} [countable] a young animal of some other type such as a young elephant or whale; \textbf{4.} [countable] (also \textbf{calfskin}) soft thin leather made from the skin of calves, used especially for making shoes \& clothing.}, displaying all manner of corporeal\footnote{\textbf{corporeal} [a] (\textit{formal}) \textbf{1.} that can be touched; physical rather than spiritual; \textbf{2.} of or for the body.} corruption\footnote{\textbf{corruption} [n] \textbf{1.} [uncountable] dishonest or illegal behavior, especially of people in authority; \textbf{2.} [uncountable] \textbf{corruption (of something)} the act or effect of making somebody change from moral to immoral standards of behavior; \textbf{3.} [countable, usually singular] \textbf{corruption of something} the form of a word or phrase that has become changed from its original form in some way; \textbf{4.} [uncountable] (\textit{computing}) the process by which mistakes are introduced into a computer file, etc. with the result that the data in it is no longer correct.}.

``I've got some good news $\ldots$ \& I've got some bad news,'' the lawgiver yells to them. ``Which do you want 1st?''

``The good news!'' the hedonists\footnote{\textbf{hedonist} [n] a person who believes that pleasure is the most important thing in life.} reply.

``I got Him from 15 commandments down to 10!''

``Hallelujah!'' cries the unruly\footnote{\textbf{unruly} [a] difficult to control or manage, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{disorderly}.} crowd. ``\& the bad?''

``Adultery\footnote{\textbf{adultery} [n] [uncountable] sex between a married person \& somebody who is not their husband or wife.} is still in.''

So rules there will be -- but, please, not too many. We are ambivalent\footnote{\textbf{ambivalent} [a] having or showing both good \& bad feelings about somebody\texttt{/}something.} about rules, even when we know they are good for us. If we are spirited souls, if we have character, rules seem restrictive, an affront\footnote{\textbf{affront} [n] [usually singular] \textbf{affront (to somebody\texttt{/}something)} a remark or an action that offends somebody\texttt{/}something, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{insult}; [v] [usually passive] (\textit{formal}) to say or do something that offends somebody, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{insult}.} to our sense of agency\footnote{\textbf{agency} [n] \textbf{1.} [countable] a business or an organization that provides a particular service especially on behalf of other businesses or organizations; \textbf{2.} [countable] (\textit{especially North American English}) a government department that provides a particular service; \textbf{3.} [uncountable, countable] a person or thing that acts to produce a particular result; action that produces a particular result.} \& our pride in working out our own lives. \fbox{Why should we be judged according to another's rule?}

\& judged we are. After all, God didn't give Moses ``The Ten Suggestions,'' he gave Commandments; \& if I'm a free agent, my 1st reaction to a command might just be that nobody, not even God, tells me what to do, even if it's good for me. But the story of the golden calf also reminds us that \fbox{without rules we quickly becomes slaves to our passions} -- \& there's nothing freeing about that.

\& the story suggests something more: unchaperoned\footnote{\textbf{unchaperoned} [a] unaccompanied or unsupervised.}, \& left to our own untutored\footnote{\textbf{untutored} [a] (\textit{formal}) not having been formally taught about something.} judgment, we are quick to aim low \& worship qualities that are beneath\footnote{\textbf{beneath} [prep] \textbf{1.} in or to a lower position than somebody\texttt{/}something; under somebody\texttt{/}something; \textbf{2.} behind an appearance or feeling; \textbf{3.} not good enough for somebody; [adv] \textbf{1.} in or to a lower position; \textbf{2.} hidden behind an appearance or feeling.} us -- in this case, an artificial\footnote{\textbf{artificial} [a] \textbf{1.} made or produced by humans to copy something natural, rather than occurring naturally; \textbf{2.} created by people; not happening naturally.} animal that brings out our own animal instincts\footnote{\textbf{instinct} [n] [uncountable, countable] a natural tendency for people \& animals to behave in a particular way, using the knowledge \& abilities that they were born with rather than thought or training.} in a completely unregulated\footnote{\textbf{unregulated} [a] not controlled by laws or official rules.} way. The old Hebrew story makes it clear how the ancients felt about our prospects\footnote{\textbf{prospect} [n] \textbf{1.} [uncountable, singular] the possibility that something will happen; \textbf{2.} [singular] an idea of what might or will happen in the future; \textbf{3.} \textbf{(prospects)} [plural] the chances of being successful.} for civilized\footnote{\textbf{civilized} [a] \textbf{1.} well-organized socially with a very developed culture \& way of life; \textbf{2.} having laws \& customs that are fair \& morally acceptable.} behavior in the absence of rules that seek to elevate\footnote{\textbf{elevate} [v] \textbf{1.} \textbf{elevate something} (\textit{specialist}) to make the level of something increase; \textbf{2.} \textbf{elevate something} \textit{specialist} to lift something up or put something in a higher position; \textbf{3.} \textbf{elevate somebody\texttt{/}something (to\texttt{/}into something)} to give somebody\texttt{/}something a higher position or rank; \textbf{4.} \textbf{elevate something} to improve a person's mood, so  that they feel happy.} our gaze\footnote{\textbf{gaze} [n] [usually singular] a long steady look at somebody\texttt{/}something; [v] [intransitive] \textbf{$+$ adv.\texttt{/}prep.} to look steadily at somebody\texttt{/}something for a long time, either because you are very interested or surprised, or because you are thinking or something else.} \& raise our standards.

1 neat\footnote{\textbf{neat} [a] \textbf{1.} in good order; carefully done or arranged; \textbf{2.} simple but clever; \textbf{3.} containing or made out of just 1 substance; not mixed with anything else.} thing about the Bible story is that it doesn't simply list its rules, as lawyers or legislators\footnote{\textbf{legislator} [n] a member of a group of people that has the power or make laws.} or administrators\footnote{\textbf{administrator} [n] \textbf{1.} a person whose job is to organize the work of a business, school or other organization; \textbf{2.} (\textit{British English, law}) a person officially chosen to manage the financial affairs of a business that cannot pay its debts.} might; it embeds\footnote{\textbf{embed} [v] [usually passive] \textbf{1.} to make something a fixed \& important part of something else, that is difficult to change or remove; \textbf{2.} \textbf{embed something (in something)} to fix something firmly into a substance or solid object; \textbf{3.} \textbf{embed something (in something)} to make images, sound, software, etc. part of a computer program; \textbf{4.} \textbf{embed something} (\textit{linguistics}) to place a sentence inside another sentence.} them in a dramatic\footnote{\textbf{dramatic} [a] \textbf{1.} (of a change or an event) sudden, very great \& often surprising; \textbf{2.} exciting \& impressive; \textbf{3.} [usually before noun] connected with the theater or plays.} tale\footnote{\textbf{tale} [n] \textbf{1.} a story created using the imagination, especially one that is full of action \& adventure; \textbf{2.} an exciting spoken description of an event, which may not be completely true.} that illustrates why we need them, thereby making them easier to understand. Similarly, in this book Prof. Peterson doesn't just propose\footnote{\textbf{propose} [v] \textbf{1.} to suggest a plan or an idea for people to consider \& decide on; \textbf{2.} to suggest an explanation of something for people to consider.} his 12 rules, he tells stories, too, bringing to bear\footnote{\textbf{bear} [v] \textbf{1.} \textbf{bear something} to have something as a characteristic or feature; to be connected with something; \textbf{2.} \textbf{bear something} to have a particular mark, word or symbol that can be seen; \textbf{3.} \textbf{bear something} to have a particular name; \textbf{4.} \textbf{bear something} to take responsibility for something difficult; to be affected by or deal with something unpleasant. If somebody \textbf{cannot bear} something, they feel unable to deal with it or accept it: \textit{Her jealous husband could not bear the possibility of his wife talking to another man.} The short form `can't\texttt{/}couldn't bear' is not suitable in academic writing, unless you are quoting.; \textbf{5.} to have a feeling, especially a negative feeling; \textbf{6.} \textbf{bear (doing) something} to be suitable for something; to be worth doing.

The 1st time I [\textsc{Norman Doidge}] met \textsc{Jordan Peterson} was on Sep 12, 2004, at the home of 2 mutual friends, TV producer Wodek Szemberg \& medical internist\footnote{\textbf{internist} [n] (\textit{North American English}) a doctor who is a specialist in the treatment of diseases of the organs inside the body \& who does not usually do medical operations.} Estera Bekier. It was Wodek's birthday party. Wodek \& Estera are Polish \'emigr\'es who grew up within the Soviet empire\footnote{\textbf{empire} [n] \textbf{1.} a group of countries or states that are controlled by 1 ruler or government; \textbf{2.} a group of commercial organizations controlled by 1 person or company.}, where it was understood that many topics were off limits, \& that casually\footnote{\textbf{casual} [a] \textbf{1.} [usually before noun] without paying attention to detail; \textbf{2.} [usually before noun] not showing much care or thought; \textbf{3.} [usually before noun] (of a relationship) lasting only a short time \& without deep affection; \textbf{4.} [usually before noun] (\textit{British English}) (of work) not permanent; not regular; \textbf{5.} not formal; \textbf{6.} [only before noun] happening by chance; doing something by chance.} questioning certain social arrangements \& philosophical ideas (not to mention the regime\footnote{\textbf{regime} [n] \textbf{1.} a government, especially one that has not been elected in a fair way; \textbf{2.} a method or system of organizing or managing something; \textbf{3.} the conditions under which a natural, scientific or industrial process occurs; \textbf{4.} $=$ \textbf{regimen}.

\textbf{regimen} [n] (also \textbf{regime}) a course of medical treatment \& sometimes changes to diet \& behavior that somebody has to follow in order to recover from or control an illness.} itself) could mean big trouble.

But now, host\footnote{\textbf{host} [n] \textbf{1.} (\textit{biology}) an animal or a plant on which another animal or plant lives \& feeds; \textbf{2.} a country, a city or an organization that arranges \& holds a special event; \textbf{3.} a country that provides homes \& work for people who come from another country; \textbf{4.} a country where a company that is based in another country does business; \textbf{5.} \textbf{host of something} a large number of people or things; \textbf{6.} the main computer in a network that controls or supplies information to other computers that are connected to it; [v] \textbf{1.} \textbf{host something} to organize an event to which others are invited \& make all the arrangements for them; \textbf{2.} \textbf{host something} to store a website on a computer connected to the Internet, usually in return for payment.} \& hostess\footnote{\textbf{hostess} [n] \textbf{1.} a woman who invites guests to a meal, a party, etc.; a woman who has people staying at her home; \textbf{2.} a woman who is employed to welcome \& entertain people at a nightclub; \textbf{3.} a woman who introduces \& talks to guests on a television or radio show, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{comp\`ere}; \textbf{4.} (\textit{North American English}) a woman who welcomes the customers in a restaurant.} luxuriated\footnote{\textbf{luxuriate in} [phrasal verb] \textbf{luxuriate in something} to relax while enjoying something very pleasant.} in easygoing\footnote{\textbf{easygoing} [a] relaxed \& happy to accept things without worrying or getting angry.}, honest\footnote{\textbf{honest} [a] \textbf{1.} always telling the truth, \& never stealing or deceiving people, \textsc{opposite}: \textbf{dishonest}; \textbf{2.} not hiding the truth about something.} talk, by having elegant\footnote{\textbf{elegant} [a] \textbf{1.} (of people or their behavior) attractive \& showing a good sense of style; \textbf{2.} (of clothes, places \& things) attractive \& designed well; \textbf{3.} (of a plan or an idea) clever but simple.} parties devoted to the pleasure\footnote{\textbf{pleasure} [n] \textbf{1.} [uncountable] a state of feeling or being happy or satisfied; the activity of enjoying yourself, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{enjoyment}; \textbf{2.} [countable] a thing that makes you happy or satisfied.} of saying what you \textit{really} thought \& hearing others do the same, in an uninhibited\footnote{\textbf{uninhibited} [a] behaving or expressing yourself freely without worrying about what other people think, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{unrestrained}, \textsc{opposite}: \textbf{inhibited}.} give-\&-take. Here, the rule was ``Speak your mind.'' If the conversation turned to politics\footnote{\textbf{politics} [n] \textbf{1.} [uncountable $+$ singular or plural verb] the activities involved in getting \& using power in public life, \& being able to influence decisions that effect a country or society; \textbf{2.} [uncountable $+$ singular or plural verb] the activities of governments concerning the political relations between states; \textbf{3.} [uncountable $+$ singular or plural verb] matters concerned with getting or using power within a particular group of organization; \textbf{4.} [plural] a person's political views or beliefs; \textbf{5.} [uncountable] $=$ \textbf{political science}; \textbf{6.} [singular] \textbf{politics (of something)} a system of political beliefs; a state of political affairs; \textbf{7.} [singular, uncountable $+$ singular or plural verb] \textbf{politics (of something)} the principles connected with a particular area of activity or interest, especially when concerned with power \& status.}, people of different political\footnote{\textbf{political} [a] \textbf{1.} connected with the state, government or public affairs; \textbf{2.} connected with the different groups working in politics, especially their policies \& the competition between them; \textbf{3.} (of people) interested in or active in politics; \textbf{4.} concerned with the competition for power within an organization, rather than with matters of principle.} persuasions\footnote{\textbf{persuasion} [n] \textbf{1.} [uncountable] the act of persuading somebody to do something or to believe something; \textbf{2.} [countable, uncountable] a particular set of beliefs, especially about religion or politics.} spoke to each other -- indeed, looked forward to it -- in a manner that is increasingly rare. Sometimes Wodek's own opinions, or truths, exploded out of him, as did his laugh. Then he'd hug whoever had made him laugh or provoked\footnote{\textbf{provoke} [v] \textbf{1.} \textbf{provoke something} to cause a particular reaction or have a particular effect; \textbf{2.} to say or do something in order to produce a strong reaction from somebody, usually anger.} him to speak his mind with greater intensity\footnote{\textbf{intensity} [n] \textbf{1.} [uncountable, singular] \textbf{intensity (of something)} the state or quality of being strong or intense; \textbf{2.} [uncountable, countable] the strength of something, e.g. light, that can be measured.} than even he might have intended. This was the best part of the parties, \& this frankness\footnote{\textbf{frank} [a] \textbf{1.} (\textbf{franker, frankest}) (\textbf{more frank} is also common) honest \& direct in what you say, sometimes in a way that other people might not like; \textbf{2.} (\textit{medical}) that cannot be confused with something else; obvious.}, \& his warm embraces\footnote{\textbf{embrace} [v] \textbf{1.} \textbf{embrace something} to accept an idea, a proposal, a set of beliefs, etc., especially when it is done with enthusiasm; \textbf{2.} \textbf{embrace something} to include something; \textbf{3.} \textbf{embrace somebody} to put your arms around somebody as a sign of love or friendship; [n] [countable, uncountable].}, made it worth provoking him. Meanwhile, Estera's voice lilted\footnote{\textbf{lilt} [n] [singular] \textbf{1.} the pleasant way in which a person's voice rises \& falls; \textbf{2.} a regular rising \& falling pattern in music, with a strong rhythm.} across the room on a very precise path towards its intended listener. \fbox{Truth explosions didn't make the atmosphere any less easygoing for the company} -- they made for more truth explosions! -- liberating\footnote{\textbf{liberate} [v] \textbf{1.} to free a country or a person from the control of somebody\texttt{/}something else; \textbf{2.} \textbf{liberate somebody\texttt{/}something (from something)} to free somebody\texttt{/}something from something that limits their ability to do things or enjoy life; \textbf{3.} (\textit{chemistry, physics}) to release gas, energy, etc. as a result of a chemical reaction or physical process.} us, \& more laughs, \& making the whole evening more pleasant, because with de-repressing\footnote{\textbf{repress} [v] \textbf{1.} \textbf{repress something} to try not to have or show an emotion, a thought, etc. In Freudian psychology, \textbf{repress} has a particular meaning, which is to stop yourself having particular thoughts or feelings so completely that they become or remain unconscious; \textbf{2.} [often passive] \textbf{repress somebody\texttt{/}something} to use political \&\texttt{/}or military force to control a group of people \& restrict their freedom, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{put something down, suppress}; \textbf{3.} \textbf{repress something} (\textit{biology}) to prevent a gene from being expressed.} Eastern Europeans like the Szemberg-Bekiers, you always knew with what \& with whom you were dealing, \& that frankness was enlivening\footnote{\textbf{enliven} [v] (\textit{formal}) \textbf{enliven something} to make something more interesting or more fun.}. Honor\'e de Balzac, the novelist\footnote{\textbf{novelist} [n] a person who writes novels.}, once described the balls \& parties in his native France, observing that what appeared to be a single party was always really 2. In the 1st hours, the gathering was suffused\footnote{\textbf{suffuse} [v] [often passive] (\textit{literary}) \textbf{suffuse somebody\texttt{/}something (with something)} (especially of a color, light or feeling) to spread all over or through somebody\texttt{/}something.} with bored people posing\footnote{\textbf{pose} [v] \textbf{1.} [transitive] \textbf{pose something} to create a problem that has to be dealt with; \textbf{2.} [transitive] \textbf{pose something} to ask a question, especially one that needs serious thought, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{raise}; \textbf{3.} [intransitive] \textbf{pose as somebody\texttt{/}something} to pretend to be somebody\texttt{/}something that you are not; \textbf{4.} [intransitive] \textbf{pose (for somebody\texttt{/}something)} to sit or stand in a particular position in order to be painted, drawn or photographed.} \& posturing\footnote{\textbf{posturing} [n] [uncountable, countable] (\textit{disapproving}) behavior that is not natural or sincere but is intended to attract attention or to have a particular effect.}, \& attendees who came to meet perhaps 1 special person who would confirm them in their beauty \& status. Then, only in the very late hours, after most of the guests had left, would the 2nd party, the real party, begin. Here the conversation was shared by each person present, \& open-hearted\footnote{\textbf{open-hearted} [a] kind \& friendly.} laughter replaced the starchy\footnote{\textbf{starchy} [a] \textbf{1.} (of food) containing a lot of starch; \textbf{2.} (\textit{informal, disapproving}) (of a person or their behavior) very formal; not friendly or relaxed.} airs. At Estera \& Wodek's parties, this kind of wee-hours-of-the-morning disclosure\footnote{\textbf{disclosure} [n] \textbf{1.} [uncountable] \textbf{disclosure (of something) (to somebody)} the act of making something known or public that was previously secret or private, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{revelation}; \textbf{2.} [countable] \textbf{disclosure} (about somebody\texttt{/}something) information or a fact that is made known or public that was previously secret or private, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{revelation}.} \& intimacy\footnote{\textbf{intimate} [a] \textbf{1.} (of a link between things) very close; \textbf{2.} (of people) having a close \& friendly relationship; \textbf{3.} sexual; \textbf{4.} private \& personal, often in a sexual way; \textbf{5.} (of a place or situation) encouraging close, friendly relationships; \textbf{6.} (of knowledge) very detailed \& thorough.

\textbf{intimacy} [n] [uncountable, countable, usually plural].} often began as soon as we entered the room.

Wodek is a silver-haired, lion-maned hunter, always on the lookout for potential public intellectuals, who knows how to spot people who can \textit{really} talk in front of a TV  camera \& who look authentic\footnote{\textbf{authentic} [a] \textbf{1.} known to be real \& genuine \& not a copy, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{genuine}; \textbf{2.} true \& accurate; based on fact; \textbf{3.} made to be exactly like the original.} because they are (the camera picks up on that). He often invites such people to these salons\footnote{\textbf{salon} [n] \textbf{1.} a shop that gives customers hair or beauty treatment or that sells expensive clothes; \textbf{2.} (\textit{old-fashioned}) a room in a large house used for entertaining guests; \textbf{3.} (in the past) a regular meeting of writers, artists \& other guests at the house of a famous or important person.}. That day Wodek brought a psychology professor, from my own University of Toronto, who fit the bill: intellect \& emotion in tandem\footnote{\textbf{tandem} [n] \textbf{in tandem (with somebody\texttt{/}something)} [idiom] a thing that works or happens in tandem with something else works together with it or happens at the same time as it.}. Wodek was the 1st to put \textsc{Jordan Peterson} in front of a camera, \& thought of him as a teacher in search of students -- because he was always ready to explain. \& it helped that he liked the camera \& that camera liked him back.

That afternoon there was a large table set outside in the Szemberg-Beliers' garden; around it was gathered the usual \fbox{collection of lips \& ears}, \& loquacious\footnote{\textbf{loquacious} [a] (\textit{formal}) talking a lot, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{talkative}.} virtuosos\footnote{\textbf{virtuoso} [n] (plural \textbf{virtuosos, virtuosi}) a person who shows very great skill at doing something, especially playing a musical instrument; [a] [only before noun] showing extremely great skill.}. We seemed, however, to be plagued\footnote{\textbf{plague} [v] \textbf{1.} \textbf{plague somebody\texttt{/}something (with something)} to cause pain or trouble to somebody\texttt{/}something over a period of time, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{trouble}; \textbf{2.} \textbf{plague somebody (with something)} to annoy somebody or create problems, especially by asking for something, demanding attention, etc., \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{hound}; [n] \textbf{1.} (also \textbf{the plague}) (also \textbf{bubonic plague}) [uncountable] a disease spread by rats that causes a high temperature, swellings ($=$ areas that are larger \& rounder than usual) on the body \& usually death; \textbf{2.} [countable] any disease that spreads quickly \& kills a lot of people, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{epidemic}; \textbf{3.} [countable] \textbf{plague of something} large numbers of an animal or insect that come into an area \& cause great damage.} by a buzzing\footnote{\textbf{buzz} [v] \textbf{1.} [intransitive] (of a bee) to make a continuous low sound; \textbf{2.} [intransitive] to make a sound like a bee buzzing; \textbf{3.} [intransitive] to be full of excitement, activity, etc.; \textbf{4.} [intransitive, transitive] \textbf{buzz (something) (for somebody\texttt{/}something)} to call somebody to come by pressing a buzzer; \textbf{5.} [transitive] \textbf{buzz somebody\texttt{/}something} (\textit{informal}) to fly very close to somebody\texttt{/}something, especially as a warning or threat; [n] \textbf{1.} [countable, usually singular] (also \textbf{buzzing} [uncountable, singular]) a continuous sound like the one that a bee, a buzzer or other electronic device makes; \textbf{2.} [singular] the sound of people talking, especially in an excited way; \textbf{3.} [singular, uncountable] (\textit{informal}) a strong feeling of pleasure, excitement or achievement; \textbf{4.} \textbf{the buzz} [singular] (\textit{informal}) news that people tell each other that may or may not be true, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{rumor}.} paparazzi\footnote{\textbf{paparazzo} [n] (also \textbf{pap}) (plural \textbf{paparazzi}) [usually plural] a photographer who follows famous people around in order to get interesting photographs of them to sell to a newspaper.} of bees, \& here was this new fellow\footnote{\textbf{fellow} [n] \textbf{1.} [usually plural] a person that you work with or that is like you; a thing that is similar to the one mentioned; \textbf{2.} (\textit{British English}) a senior member of some colleges or universities; \textbf{3.} a member of an academic or professional organization; \textbf{4.} (\textit{especially North American English}) a graduate student who holds a fellowship; [a] [only before noun] used  to describe somebody who is the same as you in some way, or in the same situation.} at the table, with an Albertan\footnote{\textbf{Alberta} [n] a province in western Canada, east of British Columbia \& west of Saskatchewan. The capital is Edmonton.} accent\footnote{\textbf{accent} [n] \textbf{1.} a way of pronouncing the words of a language that shows which country, area or social class a person comes from; \textbf{2.} the emphasis that you should give to part of a word when saying it, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{stress}; \textbf{3.} a mark on a letter to show that it should be pronounced in a particular way; \textbf{4.} [singular] \textbf{accent (on something)} a special importance that is given to something, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{emphasis}.}, in cowboy boots, who was ignoring them, \& kept on talking. He kept talking while the rest of us were playing musical chairs to keep away from the pests\footnote{\textbf{pest} [n] an insect or animal that destroys plants, food, etc.}, yet also trying to remain at the table because this new addition to our gatherings was so interesting.

He had this odd habit of speaking about the deepest questions to whoever was at this table -- most of them new acquaintances\footnote{\textbf{acquaintance} [n] \textbf{1.} [countable] a person that you know but who is not a close friend; \textbf{2.} [uncountable, countable] \textbf{acquaintance (with somebody)} (\textit{formal}) slight friendship; \textbf{3.} [uncountable, countable] \textbf{acquaintance with something} (\textit{formal}) knowledge of something.} -- as though he were just making small talk. Or, if he did do small talk, the interval between ``How do you know Wodek \& Estera?'' or ``I was a beekeeper once, so I'm used to them'' \& more serious topics would be nanoseconds\footnote{\textbf{nanosecond} [n] (abbr. \textbf{ns}) $10^{-3}$ second.}.

One might hear such questions discussed at parties where professors \& professionals\footnote{\textbf{professional} [n] a person who does a job that needs special training \& a high level of education.} gather, but usually the conversation would remain between 2 specialists\footnote{\textbf{specialist} [n] \textbf{1.} a doctor who has specialized in a particular area of medicine; \textbf{2.} \textbf{specialist (in something)} a person who is an expert in a particular area of work or study; [a] [only before noun] \textbf{1.} connected with a doctor who has specialized in a particular area of medicine; \textbf{2.} having or involving detailed knowledge of a particular topic or area of study.} in the topic, off in a corner, or if shared with the whole group it was often not without someone preening\footnote{\textbf{preen} [v] \textbf{1.} [transitive, intransitive] \textbf{preen (yourself)} (\textit{usually disapproving}) to spend a lot of time making yourself look attractive \& then admiring your appearance; \textbf{2.} [transitive] \textbf{preen yourself (on something)} (\textit{usually disapproving}) to feel very pleased with yourself about something \& show other people how pleased you are; \textbf{3.} [intransitive, transitive] \textbf{preen (itself)} (of a bird) to clean itself or make its feathers smooth with its beak.}. But this Peterson, though erudite\footnote{\textbf{erudite} [a] (\textit{formal, approving}) having or showing great knowledge that is gained from academic study, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{learned}.}, didn't come across as a pedant\footnote{\textbf{pedant} [n] (\textit{disapproving}) a person who is too concerned with small details or rules especially when learning or teaching.}. He had the enthusiasm of a kid who had just learned something new \& had to share it. He seemed to be assuming, as a child would -- before learning how dulled\footnote{\textbf{dull} [v] \textsf{pain} \textbf{1.} [transitive, intransitive] \textbf{dull (something)} to make a pain or an emotion weaker or less severe; to become weaker or less severe; \textsf{person} \textbf{2.} [transitive] \textbf{dull somebody} to make a person slower or less lively; \textsf{colors\texttt{/}sounds} \textbf{3.} [intransitive, transitive] to become less bright, clean or sharp; to make something less bright, clean or sharp; [a] \textsf{boring} \textbf{1.} not interesting or exciting, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{dreary}; \textsf{light\texttt{/}colors} \textbf{2.} not bright or shiny; \textsf{weather} \textbf{3.} not bright, with a lot of clouds, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{overcast}; \textsf{sounds} \textbf{4.} not clear or cloud; \textsf{pain} \textbf{5.} not very severe, but continuous; \textsf{person} \textbf{6.} slow in understanding, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{stupid}; \textsf{trade} \textbf{7.} (\textit{especially North American English}) not busy; slow.} adults can become -- that if he thought something was interesting, then so might others. There was something boyish\footnote{\textbf{boyish} [a] (\textit{approving}) looking or behaving like a boy, in a way that is attractive.} in the cowboy, in his broaching\footnote{\textbf{broach} [v] \textbf{broach something (to\texttt{/}with somebody)} to begin talking about a subject that is difficult to discuss, especially because it is embarrassing or because people disagree about it.} of subjects as though we had all grown up together in the same small town, or family, \& had all been thinking about the very same problems of human existence\footnote{\textbf{existence} [n] \textbf{1.} [uncountable, countable, usually singular] the state or fact of happening or being found in a particular place, time or situation; the state of being alive; \textbf{2.} [uncountable] \textbf{existence (of something)} the fact of being real; \textbf{3.} [countable, usually singular] a way of living, especially when this is difficult.} all along.

Peterson wasn't really an ``eccentric''\footnote{\textbf{eccentric} [a] considered by other people to be strange or unusual; [n] a person who is considered by other people to be strange or unusual.}; he had sufficient conventional\footnote{\textbf{conventional} [a] \textbf{1.} [usually before noun] based on what is generally believed; following the way something is usually done; \textbf{2.} (\textit{often disapproving}) tending to follow what is done or considered acceptable by society in general; normal \& ordinary, \& perhaps not very interesting, \textsc{opposite}: \textbf{unconventional}; \textbf{3.} [usually before noun] (especially of weapons) not nuclear; \textbf{4.} (of literature, art or the theater) using a traditional style or method.} chops\footnote{\textbf{chop} [v] \textbf{1.} to cut something into pieces with a sharp tool such as a knife; \textbf{2.} [usually passive] (\textit{informal}) to suddenly stop providing or allowing something; to suddenly reduce something by a large amount, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{cut}; \textbf{3.} \textbf{chop somebody\texttt{/}something} to hit somebody\texttt{/}something downwards with a quick, short movement; [n] \textbf{1.} [countable] a thick slide of meat with a bone attached to it, especially from a pig or sheep; \textbf{2.} [countable, usually singular] an act of cutting something in a quick movement downwards using an axe or a knife; \textbf{3.} [countable] an act of hitting somebody\texttt{/}something with the side of your hand in a quick movement downwards; \textbf{4.} \textbf{chops} [plural] (\textit{informal}) the part of a person's or an animal's face around the mouth; \textbf{5.} \textbf{chops} [plural] the technical skill of an actor or a jazz or rock musician.}, had been a Harvard professor, was a gentleman\footnote{\textbf{gentleman} [n] (plural \textbf{gentlemen}) \textbf{1.} (\textit{formal}) a polite or formal way of referring to a man; \textbf{2.} (in the past) a man from a high social class, especially one who did not need to work.} (as cowboys can be) though he did say \textit{damn} \& \textit{bloody} a lot, in a rural\footnote{\textbf{rural} [a] [usually before noun] connected with or like the countryside.} 1950s sort of way. But everyone listened, with fascination\footnote{\textbf{fascination} [n] \textbf{1.} [countable, usually singular] a very strong attraction, that makes something very interesting; \textbf{2.} [uncountable, singular] the state of being very attracted to \& interested in somebody\texttt{/}something.} on their faces, because he was in fact addressing questions of concern to everyone at the table.

There was something freeing about being with a person so learned\footnote{\textbf{learned} [a] [usually before noun] \textbf{1.} developed by training or experience; not existing at birth; \textbf{2.} having a lot of knowledge because you have studied \& read a lot; \textbf{3.} connected with or for leraned people; showing deep knowledge; \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{scholarly}.} yet speaking in such an unedited way. His thinking was motoric; it seemed he needed to think \textit{aloud}, to use his motor\footnote{\textbf{motor} [n] \textbf{1.} a device that uses electricity, petrol, etc. to produce movement \& makes a machine, a vehicle, a boat, etc. work; \textbf{2.} a source of power, energy or movement; \textbf{3.} (\textit{British English, old-fashioned humorous}) a car; [a] [only before noun] \textbf{1.} having an engine; using the power of an engine; \textbf{2.} (\textit{especially British English}) connected with vehicles that have engines; \textbf{3.} (\textit{specialist}) connected with movement of the body that is produced by muscles; connected with the nerves that control movement; [v] [intransitive] (\textit{British English, old-fashioned}) \textbf{$+$ adv.\texttt{/}prep.} to travel by car, especially for pleasure.} cortex\footnote{\textbf{cortex} [n] (plural \textbf{cortices}) (\textit{anatomy}) the outer layer of an organ in the body, especially the brain.} to think, but that motor also had to run fast to work properly.

He appreciated being shown another side of an issue, \& it became clear that thinking through a problem was, for him, a dialogic process.

One could not but be struck by another unusual thing about him: for an \fbox{egghead}\footnote{\textbf{egghead} [n] (\textit{informal, disapproving or humorous}) a person who is very intelligent \& is only interested in studying} Peterson was extremely practical\footnote{\textbf{practical} [a] \textbf{1.} connected with real situations rather than with ideas or theories; \textbf{2.} (of an idea, a method or a course of action) right or sensible; possible \& likely to be successful, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{feasible, workable}, \textsc{opposite}: \textbf{impractical}; \textbf{3.} (of things) useful or suitable for a particular purpose, \textsc{opposite}: \textbf{impractical}; \textbf{4.} (of a person) sensible \& realistic in the way they approach a problem or situation; \textbf{for (all) practical purposes} [idiom] used to say that something is so nearly true that it can be considered to be so; [n] (\textit{British English, informal}) a lesson or an exam in science or technology in which students have to do or make things, not just read or write about them.}. His examples were filled with applications to everyday life: business management, how to make furniture (he made much of his own), designing a simple house, making a room beautiful (now an internet meme) or in another, specific case related to education, creating an online writing project that kept minority students from dropping out of school by getting them to do a kind of psychoanalytic\footnote{\textbf{psychoanalysis} [n] (also \textbf{analysis}) [uncountable] a method of treating mental illness by investigating the influence of the unconscious mind, by getting somebody to talk about their fears, past experiences, dreams, etc.} exercise on themselves, in which they would free-associate\footnote{\textbf{free association} [n] [uncountable] \textbf{1.} the mental process by which 1 word or image may suggest another without any obvious connection; \textbf{2.} a method of treating a patient by asking them to use the mental process of free association.} about their past, present \& future (now known as the Self-Authoring Program).

I was always especially fond of mid-Western, Prairie\footnote{\textbf{prairie} [n] [countable, uncountable] a flat, wide area of land in North America \& Canada, without many trees \& originally covered with grass.} types who come from a farm (where they learned all about nature), or from a very small town, \& who have worked with their hands to make things, spent long periods outside in the harsh elements, \& are often self-educated \& go to university against the odds\footnote{\textbf{odds} [n] [plural] \textbf{1.} (usually \textbf{the odds}) the degree to which something is likely to happen; \textbf{2.} greater advantage; the state of being greater in strength, power or resources.}.

These Westerners were different: self-made, unentitled\footnote{\textbf{entitled} [a] (\textit{usually disapproving}) feeling that you have a right to the good things in life without necessarily having to work for them.}, hands on, neighborly\footnote{\textbf{neighborly} [a] \textbf{1.} involving people, countries, etc. that live or are located near each other; \textbf{2.} friendly \& helpful, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{kind}.} \& less precious\footnote{\textbf{precious} [a] \textbf{1.} rare \& worth a lot of money; \textbf{2.} valuable or important \& not to be wasted; \textbf{3.} loved or valued very much, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{treasured}; \textbf{4.} [only before noun] (\textit{informal}) used to show you are angry that another person thinks something is very important; \textbf{5.} (\textit{disapproving}) (especially of people \& their behavior) very formal, exaggerated \& not natural in what you say \& do, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{affected}.} than many of their big-city peers, who increasingly spend their lives indoors\footnote{\textbf{indoors} [v] inside or into a building, \textsc{opposite}: \textbf{outdoors}.}, manipulating symbols on computers. This cowboy psychologist seemed to care about a thought only if it might, in some way, be helpful to someone.

These paintings provided a visitor with the 1st window onto the full extent of Jordan's concern about our \fbox{human capacity for evil in the name of good}\footnote{\textbf{capacity} [n] (plural \textbf{capacities}) \textbf{1.} [countable, uncountable] the ability to understand or to do something; \textbf{2.} [uncountable, countable, usually singular] the number of things or people that a container or space can hold; \textbf{3.} [singular, uncountable] the quantity that a factory, machine, etc. can produce; \textbf{4.} [countable, usually singular] the official position or function that somebody has, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{role}; \textbf{5.}}, \& the psychological\footnote{\textbf{psychological} [a] \textbf{1.} [usually before noun] connected with a person's mind \& the way it works; \textbf{2.} [only before noun] connected with the study of psychology.} mystery\footnote{\textbf{mystery} [n] (plural \textbf{mysteries}) \textbf{1.} [countable] something that is difficult or impossible to understand or to explain; \textbf{2.} [uncountable] the quality of being difficult or impossible to understand or to explain, especially when this makes somebody\texttt{/}something seem interesting \& exciting; \textbf{3.} [countable] a story, film or play in which crimes \& strange events are only explained at the end; \textbf{4.} (\textbf{mysteries}) [plural] \textbf{mystery (of something)} the skills or knowledge needed for a particular activity \& regarded as too difficult to understand for whose without such skills or knowledge; \textbf{5.} [countable] \textbf{mystery (of somebody\texttt{/}something)} a religious belief that cannot be explained or proved in a scientific way.} of self-deception\footnote{\textbf{self-deception} [n] [uncountable] the act of making yourself believe something that you know is not true.} (how can a person deceive\footnote{\textbf{deceive} [v] [transitive] \textbf{1.} \textbf{deceive somebody} to deliberately make somebody believe something that is not true; \textbf{2.} \textbf{deceive somebody\texttt{/}something} (of a thing) to make somebody have a false idea about somebody\texttt{/}something.} himself \& get away with\footnote{\textbf{get away with (doing) something} [idiom] to do something wrong \& not be punished for it.} it?) -- an interest we share. \& then there were also the hours we'd spend discussing what I might call a lesser problem (lesser because rarer), the\\\fbox{human capacity for evil for the sake of evil}, the joy some people take in destroying others, captured famously by the 17th-century English poet John Milton in \textit{Paradise Lost}.

It was just living in the world as it was, or in some places, is.

In Jordan's 1st \& only book before this one, \textit{Maps of Meaning}, he shares his profound\footnote{\textbf{profound} [a] \textbf{1.} very great; felt or experienced very strongly; \textbf{2.} showing great knowledge or understanding; \textbf{3.} needing a lot of study or thought; \textbf{4.} (\textit{medical}) very serious; complete.} insights\footnote{\textbf{insight} [n] \textbf{1.} [countable, uncountable] an understanding of a particular situation or thing; \textbf{2.} [uncountable] the ability to see \& understand the truth about the people or situations.} into universal\footnote{\textbf{universal} [a] \textbf{1.} done by or involving all the people in the world or in a particular grooup; \textbf{2.} true or right at all times \& in all places.} themes\footnote{\textbf{theme} [n] the subject of a talk, piece of writing, exhibition, etc.; an idea that keeps returning in a piece of research or a work of art or literature.} of world mythology, \& explains how all cultures have created stories to help us grapple\footnote{\textbf{grapple} [v] \textbf{1.} [intransitive, transitive] to take a strong hold of somebody\texttt{/}something \& struggle with them; \textbf{2.} [intransitive] to try hard to find a solution to a problem.} with, \& ultimately map, the chaos into which we are thrown at birth; this chaos is everything that is unknown to us, \& any unexplored\footnote{\textbf{unexplored} [a] \textbf{1.} (of a country or an area of land) that no one has investigated or put on a map; that has not been explored; \textbf{2.} (of an area of activity or thought) that has not yet been examined or discussed thoroughly.} territory\footnote{\textbf{territory} [n] (plural \textbf{territories}) \textbf{1.} [uncountable, countable] land that is under the control of a particular country or ruler; \textbf{2.} [countable, uncountable] an area that an animal or group of animals considers as its own \& defends against others who try to enter it; \textbf{3.} [uncountable, countable] an area of knowledge, activity or experience; \textbf{4.} [countable] an area of a town, country, etc. that somebody has particular rights in or responsibility for in their work or another activity; \textbf{5.} [uncountable] a particular type of land; \textbf{6.} (\textbf{Territory}) [countable] a country or an area that is part of the US, Australia or Canada but is not a state or province.} that we must traverse\footnote{\textbf{traverse} [v] (\textit{formal}) \textbf{traverse something} to cross an area of land or water; [n] (\textit{specialist}) (in mountain climbing) an act of moving sideways across a steep slope, not climbing up or down it; a place where this is possible or necessary.}, be it in the world outside or th psyche\footnote{\textbf{psyche} [n] the mind; your deepest feelings \& attitudes.} within.

The brilliance\footnote{\textbf{brilliance} [n] [uncountable] \textbf{1.} the quality of being extremely impressive, intelligent or skillful; \textbf{2.} (\textit{formal}) (of light or colors) the quality of being very bright.} of the book is in his demonstration\footnote{\textbf{demonstration} [n] \textbf{1.} [countable, uncountable] \textbf{demonstration (of something)} an act of giving proof or evidence for something; \textbf{2.} [countable] a public meeting or march at which people show that they are protesting against or supporting somebody\texttt{/}something; \textbf{3.} [countable] an act of showing or explaining how something works or is done.} of how rooted\footnote{\textbf{rooted} [a] \textbf{1.} \textbf{rooted in something} developing from or being strongly influenced by something; \textbf{2.} \textbf{rooted in something} fixed in 1 place; not moving or changing.} this situation is in evolution, our DNA, our brains \& our most ancient stories. \& he shows that these stories have survived\footnote{\textbf{survive} [v] \textbf{1.} [intransitive] to continue to live or exist; \textbf{2.} [transitive] to continue to live or exist despite a dangerous event or time; \textbf{3.} [transitive] \textbf{survive somebody\texttt{/}something} to live or exist longer than somebody\texttt{/}something.} because they still provide guidance\footnote{\textbf{guidance} [n] [uncountable] \textbf{1.} help or advice that is given to somebody, especially by somebody in authority; \textbf{2.} the process of controlling the direction or position of something using special equipment.} in dealing with uncertainty\footnote{\textbf{uncertainty} [n] (plural \textbf{uncertainties}) \textbf{1.} [uncountable] the state of not knowing or of not being known exactly; the state of being uncertain; \textbf{2.} [countable, usually plural] something that you cannot be sure about; a situation that causes you to be uncertain.}, \& the unavoidable\footnote{\textbf{unavoidable} [a] impossible to avoid or prevent, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{inevitable}, \textsc{opposite}: \textbf{avoidable}.} unknown\footnote{\textbf{unknown} [a] \textbf{1.} not known or identified; \textbf{2.} (of people) not famous or well known; \textbf{3.} never happening or existing; [n] \textbf{1.} (\textbf{the unknown}) [singular] places or things that are not known about; \textbf{2.} [countable] a person who is not well known; \textbf{3.} [countable] a fact or an influence that is not known; \textbf{4.} [countable] (\textit{mathematics}) a quantity that does not have a known value.}.

1 of the many virtues\footnote{\textbf{virtue} [n] \textbf{1.} [countable, uncountable] \textbf{virtue (of something)} an attractive or useful quality, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{advantage}; \textbf{2.} [countable] a particular good quality or habit; \textbf{3.} [uncountable] behavior or attitudes that show high moral standards; \textbf{by\texttt{/}in virtue of (doing) something} (\textit{formal}) because or as a result of something.} of the book you are reading now is that it provides an entry point into \textit{Maps of Meaning}, which is a \fbox{highly complex work} because Jordan was working out his approach to psychology as he wrote it. But it was foundational\footnote{\textbf{foundation} [n] \textbf{1.} [countable, uncountable] a principle, an idea or a fact that something is based on \& that it grows from; \textbf{2.} [countable] an organization that is established to provide money for a particular purpose, e.g. for scientific research or charity; \textbf{3.} [uncountable] the act of starting a new institution or organization, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{establishment}; \textbf{4.} [countable, usually plural] a layer of stone, concrete, etc. that forms the solid underground base of a building; \textbf{5.} [uncountable] a skin-colored cream that is put on the face under other make-up.}, because no matter how different our genes or life experiences may be, or how differently our plastic brains are wired\footnote{\textbf{wired} [a] \textbf{1.} connected to a device or computer network by wires; \textbf{2.} (of a glass, material, etc.) containing wires that make it strong or stiff; \textbf{3.} (\textit{informal}) excited or nervous; not relaxed; \textbf{4.} (\textit{informal, especially North American English}) under the influence of alcohol or an illegal drug.} by our experience, we all have to deal with the unknown, \& we all attempt to move from chaos to order. \& this is why many of the rules in this book, being based on \textit{Maps of Meaning}, have an element of universality\footnote{\textbf{universality} [n] \textbf{1.} the fact of being done by or involving all the people in the world or in a particular group; \textbf{2.} the fact of being true or right at all times \& in all places.} to them.

\textit{Maps of Meaning} was sparked\footnote{\textbf{spark} [v] to cause something to start or develop, especially suddenly; [n] \textbf{1.} a small flash of light produced by an electric current; \textbf{2.} a very small burning piece of material that is produced by something that is burning or by hitting 2 hard substances together; \textbf{3.} an action or event that causes something important to develop, especially trouble or violence; \textbf{4.} [usually singular] \textbf{spark of something} a small amount of a particular quality or feeling.} by Jordan's agonized\footnote{\textbf{agonized} [a] (\textit{British English also} \textbf{agonised}) suffering or expressing severe pain or worry.} awareness\footnote{\textbf{awareness} [n] [uncountable, singular] \textbf{1.} the fact of knowing that something is true or exists; \textbf{2.} concern or interest in a particular situation or development.}, as a teenager growing up in the midst\footnote{\textbf{midst} [n] [singular] used after a preposition (\textit{formal}) the middle part of something, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{middle}.} of the Cold War, that much of mankind seemed on the verge\footnote{\textbf{on the verge of (doing) something} [idiom] very near to the moment when something happens or when somebody does something.} of blowing up the planet to defend their various\footnote{\textbf{various} [a] several different.} identities\footnote{\textbf{identity} [n] (plural \textbf{identities}) \textbf{1.} [countable, uncountable] the characteristics that make a person or thing who or what they are \& make them different from others; \textbf{2.} [countable, uncountable] (abbr. \textbf{ID}) \textbf{identity (of somebody\texttt{/}something)} the fact of being who or what a person or thing is; \textbf{3.} [uncountable] the state of being the same as somebody\texttt{/}something; the feeling of having a close association or connection with somebody\texttt{/}something; \textbf{4.} [countable] (\textit{mathematics}) an equation that is true for all possible values of the letters in the equation, e.g., $(x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1$.}. He felt he had to understand how it could be that people would sacrifice\footnote{\textbf{sacrifice} [n] \textbf{1.} [countable, uncountable] the fact of giving up something important or valuable to you in order to get or do something that seems more important; something that you give up in this way; \textbf{2.} [countable, uncountable] the act of offering something to a god, especially an animal that has been killed in a special way; an animal, etc. that is offered in this way; [v] \textbf{1.} [transitive] to give up something that is important or valuable to you in order to get or do something that seems more important for yourself or for another person; \textbf{2.} [transitive, intransitive] to kill an animal or a person \& offer\texttt{/}them to a god, in order to please the god.} everything for an ``identity,'' whatever that was. \& he felt he had to understand the ideologies\footnote{\textbf{ideology} [n] (plural \textbf{ideologies}) [countable, uncountable] (\textit{sometimes disapproving}) a set of ideas \& beliefs that an economic or political system is based on, or that influences the way a person or group behaves. The term \textbf{ideology} is sometimes used in a disapproving way to suggest a set of beliefs that are too fixed or not realistic or fair.} that drove totalitarian regimes to a variant\footnote{\textbf{variant} [n] a thing that is a slightly different form or type of something else, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{variation}.} of that same behavior: killing their own citizens\footnote{\textbf{citizen} [n] \textbf{1.} a person who has the legal right to belong to a particular country; \textbf{2.} a person who lives in a particular place.}. In \textit{Maps of Meaning}, \& again in this book, 1 of the matters he cautions\footnote{\textbf{caution} [n] [uncountable] \textbf{1.} care that you take in order to avoid mistakes or danger; \textbf{2.} a warning or a piece of advice about a possible danger or risk.} readers to be most wary\footnote{\textbf{wary} [a] (\textbf{warier}, no superlative) careful when dealing with somebody\texttt{/}something because you think that there may be a danger or problem, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{cautious}.} of is ideology, no matter who is peddling\footnote{\textbf{peddle} [v] \textbf{1.} \textbf{peddle something} to try to sell goods by going from house to house or from place to place; \textbf{2.} \textbf{peddle something} (\textit{usually disapproving}) to spread an idea or story in order to get people to accept it.} it or to what end.

Ideologies are simple ideas, disguised\footnote{\textbf{disguise} [v] \textbf{1.} to hide the true nature of something so that it cannot be recognized, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{conceal}; \textbf{2.} \textbf{disguise somebody\texttt{/}yourself (as somebody\texttt{/}something)} to change your appearance so that people cannot recognize you.} as science or philosophy, that purport\footnote{\textbf{purport} [v] \textbf{purport to be\texttt{/}have\texttt{/}do something} (\textit{formal}) to claim to be, have or do something, when this may not be true.} to explain\footnote{\textbf{explain} [v] \textbf{1.} [transitive, intransitive] to tell somebody about something in a way that makes it easy to understand; \textbf{2.} [intransitive, transitive] to give a reason for something; to be a reason for something.} the complexity\footnote{\textbf{complexity} [n] \textbf{1.} [uncountable] the state of being formed of many parts; the state of being difficult to understand; \textbf{2.} (\textbf{complexities}) [plural] \textbf{complexity of something} the features of a problem or situation that are difficult to understand.} of the world \& offer remedies\footnote{\textbf{remedy} [n] (plural \textbf{remedies}) \textbf{1.} a way of dealing with or improving an unpleasant or difficult situation, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{solution}; \textbf{2.} a treatment or medicine to cure a disease or to reduce pain that is not very serious; \textbf{3.} (\textit{law}) a way of dealing with a problem, using the processes of the law, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{redress}; [v] \textbf{remedy something} to correct or improve something.} that will perfect\footnote{\textbf{perfect} [a] \textbf{1.} having everything that is necessary; complete \& without faults or weaknesses; \textbf{2.} completely exact or accurate; \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{exact}; \textbf{3.} as good as it is possible to be; \textbf{4.} very good of its kind; \textbf{5.} \textbf{perfect for somebody\texttt{/}something} exactly right for somebody\texttt{/}something, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{ideal}; \textbf{6.} (\textit{grammar}) connected with the form of a verb that in English consists of part of the verb \textit{have} with the past participle of the main verb, used to express actions completed by the present or a particular point in the past or future; \textbf{in an ideal\texttt{/}a perfect world} [idiom] used to say that something is what you would like to happen or what should happen, but you know it cannot; [v] \textbf{perfect something} to develop something so that it becomes perfect or as good as possible; [n] (\textbf{the perfect}) (also \textbf{the perfect tense}) [singular] (\textit{grammar}) the form of a verb that expresses actions completed by the present or a particular point in the past or future, formed in English with part of the verb \textit{have} \& the past participle of the main verb.} it. Ideologues\footnote{\textbf{ideologue} [n] (also \textbf{ideologist}) (\textit{formal, sometimes disapproving}) a person whose actions are influenced by belief in a set of principles ($=$ by an ideology).} are people who pretend\footnote{\textbf{pretend} [v] \textbf{1.} to behave in a particular way, in order to make other people believe something that is not true; \textbf{2.} (usually used in negative sentences \& questions) to claim to be, do or have something, especially when this is not true.} they know how to ``make the world a better place'' before they've taken care of their own chaos within. (The warrior\footnote{\textbf{warrior} [n] (\textit{formal}) (especially in the past) a brave or experienced solider or fighter.} identity that their ideology gives them covers over that chaos.) That's hubris\footnote{\textbf{hubris} [n] [uncountable] (\textit{literary}) the fact of being too proud. In literature, a character with this quality ignores warnings \& laws \& this usually results in their downfall \& death.}, of course, \& 1 of the most important themes of this book, is ``set your house in order'' 1st, \& Jordan provides practical advice on how to do this.

Ideologies are substitutes\footnote{\textbf{substitute} [v] [intransitive, transitive] to take the place of somebody\texttt{/}something else; to use somebody\texttt{/}something instead of somebody\texttt{/}something else; [n] a person or thing that you use or have instead of the usual one.} for true knowledge, \& ideologues are always dangerous when they come to power\footnote{\textbf{power} [n] \textbf{1.} [uncountable] the ability to control people or things; \textbf{2.} [uncountable] political control of a country or an area; \textbf{3.} [uncountable] (\textbf{powers} [plural]) (in people) the ability or opportunity to do something or to act in a particular way; \textbf{4.} [uncountable, countable, usually plural] the right or authority of a person or group to do something; \textbf{5.} [countable] a country with a lot of influence in world affairs; \textbf{6.} [uncountable] (in compounds) strength or influence in a particular area of activity; \textbf{7.} [uncountable] the influence of a particular thing or group within society; \textbf{8.} [uncountable] \textbf{power (of something\texttt{/}somebody)} the physical strength of something\texttt{/}somebody; \textbf{9.} [uncountable] \textbf{power (of something)} the quality of being effective or having a strong effect on people's feelings or thoughts; \textbf{10.} [uncountable] energy that can be collected \& used to operate a machine, to make electricity, etc.; \textbf{11.} [countable, uncountable] \textbf{power (of something)} (\textit{mathematics}) the number of times that an amount is to be multiplied by itself.}, because a simple-minded\footnote{\textbf{simple-minded} [a] (\textit{disapproving}) not intelligent; not understanding how complicated things are.} I-know-it-all approach is no match for the \fbox{complexity of existence}. Furthermore, when their social contraptions\footnote{\textbf{contraption} [n] a machine or piece of equipment that looks strange or complicated \& possibly does not work well.} fail to fly, ideologues blame\footnote{\textbf{blame} [v] to think or say that somebody\texttt{/}something is responsible for something bad; \textbf{be to blame (for something)} [idiom] to be responsible for something bad; [n] [uncountable] responsibility for doing something badly or wrongly; saying that somebody\texttt{/}something is responsible for something.} not themselves but all who see through the simplifications\footnote{\textbf{simplification} [n] \textbf{1.} [uncountable] \textbf{simplification (of something)} the process of making something less complicated, or easier to do or understand; \textbf{2.} [countable] a change that makes a problem, statement, system, etc. less complicated or easier to understand or do.}. Another great U of T professor, Lewis Feuer, in his book \textit{Ideology \& the Ideologists}, observed that ideologies retool\footnote{\textbf{retool} [v] \textbf{1.} [transitive, intransitive] \textbf{retool (something)} to replace or change the machines or equipment in a factory so that it can produce new or better goods; \textbf{2.} [transitive] \textbf{retool something} (\textit{North American English, informal}) to organize something in a new or different way.} the very religious\footnote{\textbf{religious} [a] \textbf{1.} [only before noun] connected with religion or with a particular religion; \textbf{2.} (of a person) believing strongly in the existence of a god or gods.} stories they purport to have supplanted\footnote{\textbf{supplant} [v] (\textit{formal}) \textbf{supplant somebody\texttt{/}something} to take the place of somebody\texttt{/}something (especially somebody\texttt{/}something older or less modern), \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{replace}.}, but eliminate\footnote{\textbf{eliminate} [v] \textbf{1.} to remove or get rid of something\texttt{/}somebody; \textbf{2.} \textbf{eliminate somebody} to kill somebody, especially an enemy or opponent; \textbf{3.} \textbf{eliminate something} (\textit{mathematics}) to remove a variable from an equation, typically by substituting another which is shown by another equation to have the same value; \textbf{4.} \textbf{eliminate something} (\textit{chemistry}) to produce a simple substance such as water in addition to a more complex substance as a result of a chemical reaction involving larger organic molecules.} the narrative\footnote{\textbf{narrative} [n] \textbf{1.} [countable] a description of events, especially in a novel, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{story}; \textbf{2.} [uncountable] the act, process or skill of telling a story; \textbf{3.} [uncountable] the part of a work of literature that is narrated, as opposed to dialogue; \textbf{4.} [countable] a way of presenting a particular situation or process so that it makes clear or follows a set of aims or values; [a] [only before noun] connected with the act, process or skill of telling a story.} \& psychological richness\footnote{\textbf{richness} [n] [uncountable] the state of being rich in something, such as a variety of types or interesting qualities.}. Communism borrowed from the story of the Children of Israel in Egypt, with an enslaved\footnote{\textbf{enslave} [v] [usually passive] \textbf{1.} \textbf{enslave somebody} to make somebody a slave; \textbf{2.} \textbf{enslave somebody\texttt{/}something (to something)} [usually passive] to make somebody\texttt{/}something completely depending on something so that they cannot manage without it.} class, rich persecutors\footnote{\textbf{persecutor} [n] a person who treats another person or group of people in a cruel \& unfair way.}, a leader, like Lenin, who goes abroad, lives among the enslavers, \& then leads the enslaved to the promised\footnote{\textbf{promise} [n] \textbf{1.} [countable] a statement in which you say that you will definitely do something, or that something will definitely happen; \textbf{2.} [uncountable] the quality of being likely to be excellent or successful, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{potential}; \textbf{3.} [uncountable, singular] a sign or a reason for hope that something may happen, especially something good; [v] \textbf{1.} [intransitive, transitive] to tell somebody that you will definitely do something, or that something will definitely happen; \textbf{2.} [transitive] to make something seem likely to happen; to show signs of something.} land (the utopia; the dictatorship\footnote{\textbf{dictatorship} [n] \textbf{1.} [countable, uncountable] government by a dictator; \textbf{2.} [countable] a country that is ruled by a dictator.} of the proletariat\footnote{\textbf{the proletariat} [n] [singular $+$ singular or plural verb] (\textit{specialist}) (used especially when talking about the past) the class of ordinary people who earn money by working, especially those who do not own any property.}).

To understand ideology, Jordan read extensively\footnote{\textbf{extensively} [adv] \textbf{1.} in a way that includes or deals with a wide range of information; \textbf{2.} in a way that covers a large area; \textbf{3.} to a great extent; in a wide range of ways.} about not only the Soviet gulag\footnote{\textbf{Gulag} [n] \textbf{1.} \textbf{the Gulag} [singular] a system of prison labor camps in the Soviet Union from 1930--1955, where many people died; \textbf{2.} \textbf{gulag} [countable] any political labor camp.}, but also the Holocaust\footnote{\textbf{holocaust} [n] \textbf{1.} [countable] a situation in which many things are destroyed \& many people killed, especially because of a war or a fire; \textbf{2.} \textbf{the Holocaust} [singular] the killing of millions of Jews by the German Nazi government in the period 1941--5.} \& the rise of Nazism\footnote{\textbf{Nazism} [n] [uncountable] the policies \& beliefs of the National Socialist party which controlled Germany from 1933--1945.}.

We don't suffer only because ``politicians\footnote{\textbf{politician} [n] a person whose job is concerned with politics, especially as an elected member of parliament, etc.} are dimwitted\footnote{\textbf{dim-witted} [a] (\textit{informal}) stupid.},'' or ``the system is corrupt\footnote{\textbf{corrupt} [a] \textbf{1.} (of people) willing to use their power to do dishonest or illegal things in return for money or to get an advantage; \textbf{2.} (of behavior) dishonest or immoral; [v] \textbf{1.} \textbf{corrupt somebody} to have a bad effect on somebody \& make them behave in an immoral or dishonest way; \textbf{2.} [often passive] \textbf{corrupt something} to change the original form of something, so that it is damaged or spoiled in some way; \textbf{3.} },'' or because you \& I, like almost everyone else, can \textit{legitimately}\footnote{\textbf{legitimately} [adv] \textbf{1.} in a way that can be defended with a fair \& acceptable reason; \textbf{2.} in a way that is allowed according to the law or rules.} describe ourselves, in some way, as a victim\footnote{\textbf{victim} [n] \textbf{1.} a person who has been injured or killed as the result of a crime, disease, accident, etc.; \textbf{2.} a person, organization, etc. that has suffered because of a difficult situation, or because of the attitudes or actions of other people; \textbf{3.} an animal or person that is killed \& offered to a god; \textbf{fall victim (to something)} [idiom] to be injured, killed, damaged or destroyed by something.} of something or someone.

Rearing\footnote{\textbf{rear} [v] \textbf{1.} \textbf{rear somebody\texttt{/}something} [often passive] to care for young children or animals until they are fully grown, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{raise}; \textbf{2.} \textbf{rear something} to breed or keep animals or birds, e.g. on a farm; \textbf{something rears its head} (of something unpleasant) [idiom] to appear or happen; [n] (usually \textbf{the rear}) [singular] the back part of something; [a] at the near the back of something.} kids is hard, work is hard, aging, sickness \& death are hard, \& Jordan emphasized that doing all that totally\footnote{\textbf{totally} [adv] (used to emphasize the following word or phrase) completely.} on your own, without the benefit\footnote{\textbf{benefit} [n] \textbf{1.} [countable, uncountable] a helpful \& useful effect that something has; an advantage that something provides; \textbf{2.} [uncountable, countable] (\textit{British English}) money provided by the government to people who need financial help because they are unemployed, sick, etc.; [v] \textbf{1.} [intransitive] to be in a better position because of something; \textbf{2.} [transitive] \textbf{benefit somebody\texttt{/}something} to be useful or provide an advantage to somebody\texttt{/}something.} of a loving relationship, or wisdom, or the psychological insights of the greatest psychologists, only makes it harder. He wasn't scaring the students; in fact, they found this frank talk reassuring\footnote{\textbf{reassuring} [a] making you feel less worried or uncertain about something.}, because in the depths\footnote{\textbf{depth} [n] \textbf{1.} [countable, uncountable] the distance from the top or surface to the bottom of something; how deep something is; \textbf{2.} [uncountable] \textbf{depth (of something)} the fact of having or providing a lot of information or knowledge; \textbf{3.} [uncountable] \textbf{depth (of something)} the fact of being very important or serious; \textbf{4.} [uncountable] the quality in an image that makes it appear not to be flat; \textbf{the depths of something} [idiom] \textbf{1.} the deepest part of something; \textbf{2.} the most serious or extreme part of something; \textbf{in depth} [idiom] in a detailed \& thorough way.} of their psyches\footnote{\textbf{psyche} [n] the mind; your deepest feelings \& attitudes.}, most of them knew what he said was true, even if there was never a forum\footnote{\textbf{forum} [n] (plural \textbf{forums, fora}) \textbf{1.} a place where people can exchange opinions \& ideas on a particular issue; a meeting organized for this purpose; \textbf{2.} an Internet group or website for discussing a particular issue; \textbf{3.} (in ancient Rome) a public place where meetings were held.} to discuss it -- perhaps because the adults in their lives had become so naively\footnote{\textbf{naive} [a] (also \textbf{na\"ive}) \textbf{1.} (\textit{disapproving}) lacking experience of life, knowledge or good judgment; \textbf{2.} (\textit{approving}) (of people \& their behavior) simple \& lacking experience in life.}\,\footnote{\textbf{naively} [adv] (also \textbf{na\"ively}) \textbf{1.} (\textit{disapproving}) in a way that shows you lack knowledge, good judgment or experience of life \& are willing to believe that people always tell you the truth; \textbf{2.} (\textit{art}) in a style which is deliberately very simple, often uses bright colors \& is similar to that produced by a child.} overprotective\footnote{\textbf{overprotective} [a] (\textit{disapproving}) too anxious to protect somebody from being hurt, in a way that limits their freedom.} that they deluded\footnote{\textbf{delude} [v] to make somebody believe something that is not true, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{deceive}.} themselves into thinking that not talking about suffering would in some way magically\footnote{\textbf{magical} [a] containing magic; used in magic.}\,\footnote{\textbf{magically} [adv] \textbf{1.} in a way that cannot easily be explained \& seems to involve the use of magic; \textbf{2.} in a very beautiful or pleasant way, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{enchantingly}; \textbf{3.} by magic; using magic.} protect their children from it.

Here he would relate the myth\footnote{\textbf{myth} [n] [countable, uncountable] \textbf{1.} a story from ancient times, especially one that was told to explain natural events or to describe the early history of a people; this type of story, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{legend}; \textbf{2.} something that many people believe but that does not exist or is false, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{fallacy}.} of the hero\footnote{\textbf{hero} [n] (plural \textbf{heroes}) \textbf{1.} the main male character of a story, who usually has good qualities; \textbf{2.} a person, especially a man, who is admired by many person for doing something brave or good.}, a cross-cultural\footnote{\textbf{cross-cultural} [a] involving 2 or more different countries or cultures.} theme explored psychoanalytically \footnote{\textbf{psychoanalytically} [adv] in a way that uses or relates to psychoanalysis ($=$ treatment of mental health problems by encouraging somebody to talk about past experiences \& feelings, in order to understand fears \& feeling that they were not aware of).} by \textsc{Otto Rank}, who noted, following Freud, that hero myths are similar in many cultures\footnote{\textbf{culture} [n] \textbf{1.} [uncountable] the customs, beliefs, art, way of life or social organization of a particular country or group; \textbf{2.} [countable] a country or group with its own customs \& beliefs, art, way of life \& social organization; \textbf{3.} [countable, uncountable] the typical beliefs, attitudes \& behavior that people in a particular group or organization share; \textbf{4.} [uncountable] \textbf{culture (of something)} activities such as literature, music, art \& film, thought as a group; \textbf{5.} [uncountable] the process of growing cells or bacteria in an artificial substance for medical or scientific study; the substance in which they are grown; \textbf{6.} [countable] a group of cells or bacteria grown for medical or scientific study.}, a theme that was picked up by \textsc{Carl Jung, Joseph Campbell \& Erich Neumann}, among others. Where Freud made great contributions\footnote{\textbf{contribution} [n] \textbf{1.} [usually singular] the part played by a person or thing in achieving, improving or causing something; \textbf{2.} a sum of money that is given to a person or an organization in order to help pay for something, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{donation}; \textbf{contribution (to something)} an item that forms part of a book, magazine, broadcast, discussion, etc.; \textbf{4.} a sum of money that you pay regularly to your employer or the government in order to pay for benefits such as health insurance or a pension.} in explaining neuroses\footnote{\textbf{neurosis} [n] [countable, uncountable] (plural \textbf{neuroses}) \textbf{1.} (\textit{psychology}) a mental health condition in which a person has strong feelings of fear or worry; \textbf{2.} any strong fear or worry, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{anxiety}.} by, among other things, focusing on understanding what we might call a failed-hero story (that of Oedipus), Jordan focused on triumphant\footnote{\textbf{triumphant} [a] very successful; showing great happiness about a victory or success.} heroes. In all these triumph\footnote{\textbf{triumph} [n] \textbf{1.} [countable, uncountable] a great success, achievement or victory; \textbf{2.} [uncountable] the state of having achieved a great success or victory; the feeling of happiness that you get from this; [v] [intransitive] to defeat somebody\texttt{/}something; to be successful.} stories, the hero has to go into the unknown, into an unexplored territory, \& deal with a new great challenge \& take great risks. In the process, something of himself has to die, or be given up, so he can be reborn\footnote{\textbf{reborn} [v] \textbf{be reborn} used only in the passive without \textit{by}, \textbf{1.} to become active or popular again; \textbf{2.} to be born again; [a] [usually before noun] \textbf{1.} having become active again; \textbf{2.} having experienced a complete spiritual change.} \& meet the challenge. This requires courage\footnote{\textbf{courage} [n] [uncountable] the ability to do something dangerous, or to face pain or opposition, without showing fear, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{bravery}.}, something rarely discussed in a psychology class or textbook\footnote{\textbf{textbook} [n] (\textit{North American English also} \textbf{text}) a book that teaches a particular subject \& that is used especially in schools \& colleges.}. During his recent public stand for free speech \& against what I call ``forced speech'' (because it involves a government forcing citizens to voice political views), the stakes were very high, he had much to lose, \& knew it. Nonetheless, I saw him (\& Tammy, for that matter) not only display such courage, but also continue to live by many of the rules in this book, some of which can be very demanding\footnote{\textbf{demanding} [a] \textbf{1.} (of a task) needing a lot of skill, care or effort; \textbf{2.} (of a person) expecting a lot of work or attention from others; not easily satisfied.}.

I saw him grow, from the remarkable\footnote{\textbf{remarkable} [a] unusual or surprising in a way that causes people to take notice, \textsc{opposite}: \textbf{unremarkable}.} person he was, into someone even more able \& assured -- through living by these rules. In fact, it was the process of writing this book, \& developing these rules, that led him to take the stand he did against forced or compelled\footnote{\textbf{compel} [v] \textbf{1.} to force somebody to do something; \textbf{2.} \textbf{compel something} to make something happen through the use of force or pressure; \textbf{3.} compel something (not used in the progressive tenses) to cause a particular reaction.} speech. \& that is why, during those events, he started posting some of his thoughts about life \& these rules on the Internet. Now, over 100 million YouTube hits later, we know they have struck\footnote{\textbf{strike} [v] \textbf{1.} [transitive] \textbf{strike somebody\texttt{/}something} to hit somebody\texttt{/}something hard or with force; \textbf{2.} [transitive] \textbf{strike somebody\texttt{/}something} to hit somebody\texttt{/}something with your hand or a weapon; \textbf{3.} [intransitive, transitive] to attack somebody\texttt{/}something, especially suddenly; \textbf{4.} [intransitive, transitive] to happen suddenly \& have a harmful or damaging effect on somebody\texttt{/}something; \textbf{5.} [intransitive, transitive] (of lighting) to hit \& hurt or damage somebody\texttt{/}something on the ground; \textbf{6.} [transitive] \textbf{strike something} (of light) to fall on a surface; \textbf{7.} [transitive, often passive] to cause somebody to notice or be interested; to make a particular impression on somebody; \textbf{8.} [intransitive] to refuse to work, because of a disagreement over pay or conditions.} a chord\footnote{\textbf{chord} [n] \textbf{1.} (\textit{music}) 3 or more notes played together; \textbf{2.} (\textit{mathematics}) a straight line that joins 2 points on a curve; \textbf{strike\texttt{/}touch a chord (with somebody)} [idiom] to say or do something that makes people feel sympathy or enthusiasm.}.

Given our distaste\footnote{\textbf{distaste} [n] [uncountable, singular] a feeling that something is unpleasant or offensive.} for rules, how do we explain the extraordinary\footnote{\textbf{extraordinary} [a] \textbf{1.} unexpected, surprising or strange; \textbf{2.} not normal or ordinary; greater or better than usual; \textbf{3.} [only before noun] (of a meeting, etc.) arranged for a special purpose \& happening in addition to what normally or regularly happens.} response to his lectures\footnote{\textbf{lecture} [n] a talk that is given to a group of people to teach them about a particular subject, often as part of a university or college course; [v] [intransitive] \textbf{lecture (in\texttt{/}on something) (to somebody)} to give a talk or a series of talks to a group of people on a particular subject, especially as a way of teaching in a university or college.}, which give rules? In Jordan's case, it was of course his charisma\footnote{\textbf{charisma} [n] [uncountable] the powerful personal quality that some people have to attract \& impress other people.} \& a rare willingness\footnote{\textbf{willingness} [n] [uncountable, singular] \textbf{willingness (of somebody) to do something} the fact of being willing to do something.} to stand for a principle that got him a wide hearing online initially\footnote{\textbf{initially} [adv] at the beginning.}; views of his 1st YouTube statements quickly numbered in the hundreds of thousands. But people have kept listening because what he is saying meets a deep \& unarticulated\footnote{\textbf{articulated} [a] (of a vehicle) with 2 or more sections joined together in a way that makes it easier to turn corners.} need. \& that is because alongside\footnote{\textbf{alongside} [prep] \textbf{1.} next to or at the side of something; \textbf{2.} together with something\texttt{/}somebody; at the same time as something\texttt{/}somebody.} our wish to be free of rules, we all search for structure\footnote{\textbf{structure} [n] \textbf{1.} [uncountable, countable] the way in which the parts of something are connected together, arranged or organized; a particular arrangement of parts; \textbf{2.} [countable] a thing that is made of several parts arranegd in a particular way, e.g. a building; \textbf{3.} [uncountable, countable] the state of being well organized or planned with all the parts linked together; a careful plan; [v] [often passive] to arrange or organize something into a system or pattern.}.

The hunger\footnote{\textbf{hunger} [n] \textbf{1.} [uncountable] the state of not having enough food to eat, especially when this causes illness or death; \textbf{2.} [uncountable] the feeling caused by a need to eat; \textbf{3.} [singular] \textbf{hunger (for something)} (\textit{formal}) a strong desire for something.} among many younger people for rules, or at least guidelines\footnote{\textbf{guideline} [n] \textbf{1.} [usually plural] a rule or instruction that is given by an official organization telling you how to do something; \textbf{2.} something that can be used to help you decide or form an opinion about something.}, is greater today for good reason. In the West at least, millennials\footnote{\textbf{millennial} [n] [usually plural] a person who was born between the early 1980s \& the late 1990s; a member of Generation Y.} are living through a unique historical situation. They are, I believe, the 1st generation to have been so thoroughly\footnote{\textbf{thoroughly} [adv] \textbf{1.} very; very much; completely; \textbf{2.} carefully \& with great attention to detail.} taught 2 seemingly\footnote{\textbf{seemingly} [adv] in a way that appears to be true but may in fact not be, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{apparently}.} contradictory\footnote{\textbf{contradictory} [a] containing or showing a contradiction.} ideas about morality\footnote{\textbf{morality} [n] (plural \textbf{moralities}) \textbf{1.} [uncountable] principles concerning right \& wrong or good \& bad behavior; \textbf{2.} [uncountable] the degree to which something is right or wrong, or good or bad, according to moral principles; \textbf{3.} [uncountable, countable] a system of moral principles followed by a particular group of people.}, simultaneously\footnote{\textbf{simultaneously} [adv] at the same time as something else.} -- at their schools, colleges \& universities, by many in my own generation. This contradiction\footnote{\textbf{contradiction} [n] \textbf{1.} [countable, uncountable] a lack of agreement between facts, opinions or actions; \textbf{2.} [uncountable, countable] the act of saying that something that somebody else has said is wrong or not true; an example of this; \textbf{a contradiction in terms} [idiom] a statement containing 2 words or phrases that contradict each other's meaning.} has left them at times disoriented\footnote{\textbf{disorientated} [a] (also \textbf{disoriented}) \textbf{1.} unable to recognize where you are or where you should go; \textbf{2.} feeling confused \& unable to think clearly.} \& uncertain\footnote{\textbf{uncertain} [a] \textbf{1.} [not before noun] feeling doubt about something; not sure, \textsc{opposite}: \textbf{certain}; \textbf{2.} likely to change, especially in a negative or unpleasant way; \textbf{3.} not definite or decided; not known exactly, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{unclear}; \textbf{4.} not confident; \textbf{in no uncertain terms} [idiom] clearly \& strongly.}, without guidance\footnote{\textbf{guidance} [n] [uncountable] \textbf{1.} help or advice that is given to somebody, especially by somebody in authority; \textbf{2.} the process of controlling the direction or position of something using special equipment.} \&, more tragically\footnote{\textbf{tragically} [adv] in a way that makes you feel very sad, usually because somebody has died or suffered a lot.}, deprived\footnote{\textbf{deprived} [a] without enough food, education, \& all the things that are necessary for people to live a happy \& comfortable life.} of\footnote{\textbf{deprive of} [phrasal verb] \textbf{deprive somebody\texttt{/}something of something} to prevent somebody from having or doing something, especially something important.} riches they don't even know exist.

The 1st idea or teaching is that \fbox{morality is relative}, at best a personal ``value judgment.'' \textit{Relative} means that there is no absolute right or wrong in anything; instead, morality \& the rules associated with it are just a matter of personal opinion or happenstance\footnote{\textbf{happenstance} [n] [uncountable, countable] (\textit{especially North American English}) chance, especially when it results in something good.}, ``relative to'' or ``related to'' a particular framework\footnote{\textbf{framework} [n] \textbf{1.} a set of beliefs, ideas or principles that is used as the basis for examining or understand something; \textbf{2.} a system of rules, laws or agreements that controls the way that something works in business, politics or society.}, such as one's ethnicity\footnote{\textbf{ethnicity} [n] (plural \textbf{ethnicities}) [uncountable, countable] the fact or state of belonging to a social group that has a shared national or cultural tradition.}, one's upbringing\footnote{\textbf{upbringing} [n] [singular, uncountable] the way in which a child is cared for \& taught how to behave while it is growing up.}, or the culture or historical\footnote{\textbf{historical} [a] [usually before noun] \textbf{1.} connected with the past; \textbf{2.} connected with the study of history; \textbf{3.} (of a book or film) about people \& events in the past.} moment one is born into. It's nothing but an accident\footnote{\textbf{accident} [n] \textbf{1.} [countable] an unpleasant event, especially in a vehicle, that happens unexpected \& causes injury or damage; \textbf{2.} [countable, uncountable] something that happens by chance; \textbf{by accident} [idiom] in a way that is not planned or organized, \textsc{opposite}: \textbf{deliberately, on purpose}.} of birth. According to this argument\footnote{\textbf{argument} [n] \textbf{1.} [countable, uncountable] a reason or set of reasons that somebody uses to show that something is true or correct; \textbf{2.} [countable, uncountable] \textbf{argument (with somebody)} (about\texttt{/}over something) a discussion in which 2 or more people disagree; \textbf{3.} [countable] \textbf{argument of a function} (\textit{mathematics}) any of the independent variables that the value of a function depends on; \textbf{4.} [countable] (\textit{mathematics}) the angle formed by the line between a complex number \& the origin, \& the real, positive axis; \textbf{for the sake of argument} [idiom] for the purpose of having a discussion.} (now a creed\footnote{\textbf{creed} [n] [countable, uncountable] a set of principles or religious beliefs; a statement of these principles or beliefs.}), history teaches that religions, tribes\footnote{\textbf{tribe} \textbf{1.} a social group in a traditional society consisting of families or communities with the same culture, language, religion, etc. \& usually with a particular leader; \textbf{2.} (\textit{biology}) a group of related animals or plants that is larger than a genus \& smaller than a family.}, nations\footnote{\textbf{nation} [n] \textbf{1.} [countable] a country considered as a group of people with the same language, culture \& history, who live in a particular area under 1 government; \textbf{2.} [singular] all the people in a country, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{population}.} \& ethnic\footnote{\textbf{ethnic} [a] connected with or belonging to a race or people that shares a cultural tradition.} groups tend to disagree\footnote{\textbf{disagree} [v] \textbf{1.} [intransitive] to have or express a different opinion from somebody else, \textsc{opposite}: \textbf{agree}; \textbf{2.} [intransitive] (of 2 results or reports) to give different information about the same thing, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{conflict}, \textsc{opposite}: \textbf{agree}; \textbf{disagree with something} [phrasal verb] to disapprove of something.} about fundamental\footnote{\textbf{fundamental} [a] \textbf{1.} serious \& very important; affecting the most central \& important parts of something, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{basic}; \textbf{2.} forming the necessary basis of something, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{essential}.} matters, \& always have.

So, the decent\footnote{\textbf{decent} [a] \textbf{1.} of a good enough standard or quality; \textbf{2.} (of people or behavior) honest \& fair; treating people with respect; \textbf{3.} acceptable according to the moral or social rules of a particular group.} thing to do -- once it becomes apparent\footnote{\textbf{apparent} [a] \textbf{1.} [not usually before noun] easy to see or understand, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{obvious}; \textbf{2.} [usually before noun] that seems to be true, but may not be so, \textsc{synonym}: seeming.} how arbitrary\footnote{\textbf{arbitrary} [a] \textbf{1.} (of a decision, rule, system, etc.) not seeming to be based on reason, \& sometimes seeming unfair; \textbf{2.} using power or authority without restriction \& without considering other people; \textbf{3.} (\textit{mathematics}) (of a quantity) of a value that is not stated.} your, \& your society's, ``moral values'' are -- is to show tolerance\footnote{\textbf{tolerance} [n] \textbf{1.} [uncountable] willingness to accept or tolerate somebody\texttt{/}something, especially opinions or behavior that you may not agree with, or people who are not like you; \textbf{2.} [countable, uncountable] the ability to suffer something, especially pain, difficult conditions, etc. without being harmed; \textbf{3.} [countable, uncountable] \textbf{tolerance (of something)} (\textit{specialist}) the amount by which the measurements of a manufactured object may be allowed to vary without causing problems.} for
