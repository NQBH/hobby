As I read your book, I felt for the 1st time in my life that someone truly understood what it was like to go through life as a highly sensitive individual $\ldots$ Your book was the 1st that I have ever read that not only validated the traits of highly sensitive individuals but cast them as necessary for our society.'' -- M. C., Rockaway, NJ

\section*{Acknowledgments}
``I especially want to acknowledge all the highly sensitive person I interviewed. You were the 1st to come forward \& talk about what you had known very privately about yourself for a long time, changing yourselves from isolated individuals to a group to be respected. My thanks also to those who have come to my courses or seen me for a consultation or in psychotherapy. Every word of this book reflects what you all have taught me.

My many student research assistants -- too many to name -- also earn a big thanks, as do Barbara Kouts, my agent, \& Bruce Shostak, my editor at Carol, for their effort to see that this book reached all of you. Barbara found a publisher with vision; Bruce brought the manuscript into good shape, reining me in at all the right places but otherwise letting me run with it as I saw it.

It's harder to find words for my husband, Art. But here are some: Friend, colleague, supporter, beloved-thanks, with all my love.'' -- \cite[p. 6]{Aron2013}

\begin{quotation}
	``I believed in aristocracy, though -- if that is the right word, \& if a democrat may use it. Not an aristocracy of power $\ldots$ but $\ldots$ of the sensitive, the considerate $\ldots$ Its members are to be found in all nations \& classes, \& all through the ages, \& there is a secret understanding between them when they meet. They represent the true human tradition, the 1 permanent victory of our queer race over cruelty \& chaos. Thousands of them perish in obscurity, a few are great names. They are sensitive for others as well as themselves, they are considerate without being fussy, their pluck is not swankiness but the power to endure $\ldots$'' -- E. M. Forster, ``What I Believe,'' in \textit{2 Cheers for Democracy}

\section*{Author's Note, 2012}
``In 1998, 3 years after this book was 1st published, I wrote a new preface for it titled ``A Celebration.'' It was an invitation for all of us to feel good about how many people had discovered they were highly sensitive \& found the book useful, \& that the idea was catching on in the scientific world. Now we can celebrate about 50 times more of the same. \textit{The Highly Sensitive Person} has been translated into 14 languages, from Swedish, Spanish, \& Korean to Hebrew, French, \& Hungarian. There have been articles about high sensitivity in many prominent media throughout  the world. In the U.S., that has included a feature in \textit{Psychology Today}, a shorter discussion in \textit{Time}, \& many women's \& health magazines such as \textit{O Magazine} as well as numerous health websites. There are ``HSP Gatherings'' \& courses on the subject in the United States \& Europe, plus YouTube videos, books, magazines, newsletters, \& websites \& all sorts of services exclusively highly sensitive persons -- most good \& some, well, not as good. Tens of thousands subscribe to my own newsletter, \textit{Comfort Zone}, at \url{hsperson.com}, where there are now hundreds of newsletter articles archived covering every aspect of being highly sensitive. We have come a long way.
