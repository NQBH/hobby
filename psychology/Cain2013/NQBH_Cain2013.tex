\section*{More Advance Noise for \textit{Quiet}}

\begin{quotation}
	``An intriguing \& potentially life-altering examination of the human psyche that is sure to benefit both introverts \& extroverts alike.'' -- Kirkus Reviews (starred review)
	
	``Gentle is powerful $\ldots$ Solitude is socially productive $\ldots$ These important counterintuitive ideas are among the many reasons to take \textit{Quiet} to a quiet corner \& absorb its brilliant, thought-provoking message.'' -- Rosabeth Moss Kanter, professor at Harvard Business School, author of \textit{Confidence} \& \textit{SuperCorp}
	
	``All informative, well-researched book on the power of quietness \& the virtues of having a rich inner life. It dispels the myth that you have to be extroverted to be happy \& successful.'' -- Judith Orloff, M.D., author of \textit{Emotional Freedom}
	
	``In this engaging \& beautiful written book, Susan Cain makes a powerful case for the wisdom of introspection. She also warns us ably about the downside to our culture's noisiness, including all that it risks drowning out. About the din, Susan's own voice remains a compelling presence -- thoughtful, generous, calm, \& eloquent. \textit{Quiet} deserves a very large readership.'' -- Christopher Lane, author of \textit{Shyness: How Normal Behavior Became a Sickness}
	
	``Susan Cain's quest to understand introversion, a beautifully wrought journey from the lab bench to the motivational speaker's hall, offers convincing evidence for valuing substance over style, steak over sizzle, \& qualities that are, in America, often derided. This book is brilliant, profound, full of feeling \& brimming with insights.'' -- Sheri Fink, M.D., author of \textit{War Hospital}
	
	``Brilliant, illuminating, empowering! \textit{Quiet} gives not only a voice, but a path to homecoming for so may who've walked through the better part of their lives thinking the way they engage with the world is something in need of fixing.'' -- Jonathan Fields, authors of \textit{Uncertainty: Turning Fear \& Doubt into Fuel for Brilliance}
	
	``Shatters misconceptions $\ldots$ Cain consistently holds the reader's interest by presenting individual profiles $\ldots$ \& reporting on the latest studies. Her diligence, research, \& passion for this important topic has richly paid off.'' -- Adam M. Grant, Ph.D., associate professor of management, the Wharton School of Business
	
	``Once in a blue moon, a book comes along that gives us startling new insights. \textit{Quiet} is that book: it's part page-turner, part cutting-edge science. The implications for business are especially valuable: \textit{Quiet} offers tips on how introverts can lead effectively, give winning speeches, avoid burnout, \& choose the right roles. This charming, gracefully written, thoroughly researched book is simply masterful.'' -- Publishers Weekly
	
	``\textit{Quiet} elevates the conversation about introverts in our outwardly oriented society to new heights. I think that many introverts will discover that, even though they didn't know it, they have been waiting for this book all their lives.'' -- Adam S. McHugh, author of \textit{Introverts in the Church}
	
	``Susan Cain's \textit{Quiet} is wonderfully informative about the culture of the extravert ideal \& the psychology of a sensitive temperament, \& she is helpful perceptive about how introverts can make the most of their personality preferences in all aspects of life. Society needs introverts, so everyone can benefit from the insights in this important book.'' -- Jonathan M. Cheek, professor of psychology at Wellesley College, co-editor of \textit{Shyness: Perspectives on Research \& Treatment}
	
	``A brilliant, important, \& personally affecting book. Cain shows that, for all its virtue, America's Extrovert Ideal takes up way too much oxygen. Cain herself is the perfect person to make this case -- with winning grace \& clarity she shows us what it looks like to think outside the group.'' -- Christine Kenneally, author of \textit{The 1st Word}
	
	``What Susan Cain understands -- \& readers of this fascinating volume will soon appreciate -- is something that psychology \& our fast-moving \& fasttalking society have been all too slow to realize: Not only is there really nothing wrong with being quiet, reflective, shy, \& introverted, but there are distinct advantages to being this way.'' -- Jay Belsky, Robert M. \& Natalie Reid Dorn Professor, Human \& Community Development, University of California, Davis
	
	``Author Susan Cain exemplifies her own quiet power in this exquisitely written \& highly readable page-turner. She brings important research \& poignant, personal examples into the light, greatly deepening our understanding of the introvert experience.'' -- Jennifer B. Kahnweiler, Ph.D., author of \textit{The Introverted Leader}
	
	\textit{``A species in which everyone was General Patton would not succeed, any more than would a race in which everyone was Vincent van Gogh. I prefer to think that the planet needs athletes, philosophers, sex symbols, painters, scientists; it needs the warmhearted, the hardhearted, the coldhearted, \& the weakhearted. It needs those who can devote their lives to studying how many droplets of water are secreted by the salivary glands of dogs under which circumstances, \& it needs those who can capture the passing impression of cherry blossoms in a 14-syllable poem or devote 25 pages to the dissection of a small boy's feelings as he lies in bed in the dark waiting for his mother to kiss him goodnight $\ldots$ Indeed the presence of outstanding strengths presupposes that energy needed in other areas has been channeled away from them.''} -- Allen Shawn

\section*{Author's Note}
``I have been working on this book officially since 2005, \& unofficially for my entire adult life. I have spoken \& written to hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people about the topics covered inside, \& have read as many books, scholarly papers, magazine articles, chat-room discussions, \& blog posts. Some of these I mention in the book; others informed almost every sentence I wrote. \textit{Quiet} stands on many shoulders, especially the scholars \& researchers whose work taught me so much. In a perfect world, I would have named every 1 of my sources, mentors, \& interviewees. But for the sake of readability, some names appear only in the Notes or Acknowledgments.

For similar reasons, I did not use ellipses or brackets in certain quotations but made sure that the extra or missing words did not change the speaker's or writer's meaning. If you would like to quote these written sources from the original, the citations directing you to the full quotations appear in the Notes.

I've changed the names \& identifying details of some of the people whose stories I tell, \& in the stories of my own work as a lawyer \& consultant. To protect the privacy of the participants in Charles di Cagno's public speaking workshop, who did not plan to be included in a book when they signed up for the class, the story of my 1st evening in class is a composite based on several sessions; so is the story of Greg \& Emily, which is based on many interviews with similar couples. Subject to the limitations of memory, all other stories are recounted as they happened or were told to me. I did not fact-check the stories people told me about themselves, but only included those I believed to be true.'' -- \cite[p. 12]{Cain2013}
