\subsection{Amazon's Review}
``For David Goggins, childhood was a nightmare -- poverty, prejudice, \& physical abuse colored his days \& haunted his nights. But through self-discipline, mental toughness, \& hard work, Goggins transformed himself from a depressed, overweight young man with no future into a U.S. Armed Forces icon \& one of the world's top endurance athletes. The only man in history to complete elite training as a Navy SEAL, Army Ranger, \& Air Force Tactical Air Controller, he went on to set records in numerous endurance events, inspiring Outside magazine to name him ``The Fittest (Real) Man in America.''

In Can't Hurt Me, he shares his astonishing life story \& reveals that most of us tap into only 40\% of our capabilities. Goggins calls this The 40\% Rule, \& his story illuminates a path that anyone can follow to push past pain, demolish fear, \& reach their full potential.''

\section{Quotes}
See \cite{Goggins2018}.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item ``Everything in life is a mind game! Whenever we get swept under by life's dramas, large \& small, we are forgetting that no matter how bad the pain gets, no matter how harrowing the torture, all bad things end.''
	\item ``If you want to master the mind \& remove your governor, you'll have to become addicted to hard work. Because passion \& obsession, even talent, are only useful tools if you have the work ethic to back them up.''
	\item ``The reason it's important to push hardest when you want to quit the most is because it helps you callous your mind. It's the same reason why you have to do your best work when you are the least motivated. That's why I loved PT in BUD\texttt{/}S \& why I still love it today. Physical challenges strengthen my mind so I'm ready for whatever life throws at me, \& it will do the same for you.''
	\item ``By the time I graduated, I knew that the confidence I'd managed to develop didn't come from a perfect family or God-given talent. It came from personal accountability which brought me self respect, \& self-respect will always light a way forward.''
\end{enumerate}
