\section{Introduction}

\subsection{An Adventure}
``Finding yourself involved with a psychopath is an adventure, that's fore sure. It will open your eyes to human nature, our broken society, \&, perhaps most important of all, your own spirit. It's a dark journey that will throw you into spells of depression, rage, \& loneliness. It will unravel your deepest insecurities, leaving you with a lingering emptiness that haunts your every breath.

But ultimately, it will heal you.

You will become stronger than you could ever imagine. You will understand who you are truly meant to be. \& in the end, you will be glad it happened.

No one ever believes me about that last part. At least, not at 1st. But I promise you, it's an adventure worth taking. One that will change your life forever.

\textit{So what is a psychopath? How about a narcissist or a sociopath?} They're manipulative people -- completely devoid of empathy -- who intentionally cause harm to others without any sense of remorse or responsibility. \& despite some differences between each disorder, the bottom line is that their relationship cycles can be predicted like clockwork: Idealize, Devalue, Discard.

Years ago, this cycle had me thinking I'd never be happy again. Falling in love had somehow wiped out my entire sense of self. Instead of being joyful \& trusting, I had become an unrecognizable mess of insecurities \& anxiety.

But life is a lot of fun these days -- mostly just running around outside in my bathing suit \& eating pizza. \& this is all thanks to a lucky Google search that lead me to psychopathy, which led me to the friends who saved my life, which led us to cofound a tiny online recovery community, which now reaches millions of survivors every month!

At \url{PsychopathFree.com}, we see new members join every single day, always with a seemingly hopeless \& all-too-familiar tale. Left feeling lost \& broken, they wonder if they will ever find happiness again.

1 year later, that person is nowhere to be found.

In his or her place, there is a beautiful stranger who stands tall \& helps others out from the shadows. A stranger who takes pride in their own greatest qualities: empathy, compassion, \& kindness. A stranger who speaks of self-respect \& boundaries. A stranger who practices introspection in order to better conquer their own demons.

So what happened in that year?

Well, a lot of good stuff. So much that I had to write a book. I might be biased -- actually, I definitely am -- but I think \url{PsychopathFree.com} has 1 of the coolest healing process out there. We believe in education, open dialogue, validation, \& self-discovery. We have a uniquely inspiring user base, full of resilient values \& honest friendships.

Yes, friendships. Because this journey is personal, but it's also remarkably universal. Whether it be a whirlwind romance, a scheming coworker, an abusive family member, or a life-consuming affair, a relationship with a psychopath is always the same. Your mind is left spinning. You feel worthless \& lost. You become numb to the things that once made you happy.

I cannot fix a toxic relationship (because toxic people cannot change), but I can give you a new place to start. \& I can promise that you will feel joy again. You will learn to trust your intuition. You will walk this world with the wisdom of a survivor \& the gentle wonder of a dreamer.

But 1st, you'll need to forget everything you thought you knew about people. Understanding psychopathy requires letting go of your basic emotional instincts. Remember, these are people who prey on forgiveness. They thrive on your need for closure. They manipulate compassion \& exploit sympathy.

Since the dawn of time, psychopaths have waged psychological warfare on others -- humiliating \& shaming kind, unsuspecting victims -- people who never asked for it; people who aren't even aware of the war until it's over.

But this is all about to change.

So say farewell to love triangles, cryptic letters, self-doubt, \& manufactured anxiety. You will never again find yourself desperately awaiting a text from the person you love. You will never again censor your spirit for fear of losing the ``perfect'' relationship. You will never again be told to stop overanalyzing something that urgently needs analysis. You are no longer a pawn in the mind games of a psychopath. You are free.

\& now it's time for your adventure.

Love, Jackson.'' -- \cite[pp. 7--9]{MacKenzie2015}
