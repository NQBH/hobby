\section*{Foreword}
``3 years ago, my reality was imploding all around me like a scene from the movie \textit{Inception}. Everything I had believed to be true was suddenly collapsing. I was forced to face the truth. Until that moment, I couldn't quite put my finger on exactly what the problem was. I was mostly in denial about it, but I think I knew something was wrong for a while.

As 1 of my friends mentioned the word narcissist, she pointed out, ``He's like the ones from the past, he's just the more sophisticated model.''

The heart-breaking dissolution of that relationship sent me on a journey to Peru where I met several more characters like him, mostly in my work life. A year later \& totally devastated, I reluctantly went back to the original covert abuser in my life to get on my feet again.

Back where it all began, 1st the complex-PTSD breakdown happened \& then I broke through. Observing my mother with new awareness, I was finally able to see where that pattern of relationships came from. In facing my wound \& working on healing, I created a new sense of purpose \& the work I do now to help people self-heal after narcissistic abuse.

Recently, when 1 of my clients told me she was writing a book on covert narcissists, I was so excited that I offered to write the foreword. I'm grateful that Debbie dedicated herself to write this book on such an important, nuanced topic within the genre of narcissistic abuse.

This book is meeting a great need because unfortunately there is not enough information available for people who have been through the more covert forms of abuse. It's incredibly sophisticated \& stealth, so it's often missed by mental health professionals who were not trained to recognize it.

Debbie writes,
\begin{quotation}\it
	``You think you're on the right track after discovering narcissistic personality disorder, but then you read things that are not completely what you experienced.''
	
	``Coverts do have a grandiose sense of self, are preoccupied with fantasies of power, require excessive admiration, but they hide all these attributes so people will like \& trust them.''
\end{quotation}
She \textit{gets} it. The author clearly knows this war from the front lines.

After years of talking with people in my personal \& professional life about covert narcissists, I've come to believe that in order to really understand the nature of the covert narcissist, you have to have lived it. Whether it's a spouse, significant other, friendship, boss, co-worker, neighbor or family member, the patterns are nearly identical \& only someone who has been inside that nightmare can really know what the experiences is like. Even then it's hard to describe.

I believe the covert types are by far the most dangerous because of their ability to fly stealth, undetected by normal radar. They leverage their intelligence through a meticulous choice of words \& silence in order to manipulate others. The smarter the narcissist, the more dangerous because the cloak of invisibility is so high-tech.

The overt type of abuser is much more obvious because they lack the intelligence to manipulate that cleverly, so they resort to aggression \& violence as their primary weapons.

Plausible deniability is the covert narcissist's greatest weapon in their arsenal of gaslighting tools.

With a covert narcissist everything on the surface looks normal \& often lovely for months, years, even decades. They know how to say all the right things, exactly the things that you personally want to hear. They can mirror empathy, concern, \& tears better than most Hollywood actors. However, underneath the surface the feeling is off. It's so subtle that you could easily miss it or dismiss it.

After a relationship with a covert narcissist, you feel like you can't trust your perception of reality because no one else can see what you see. Most people adore covert narcissists because of how very careful they are in choosing who they unmask around \& how much effort they put into optics \& public perception.

When you ask for advice from friends \& even professionals, you might only hear people giving the benefit of the doubt to the covert narcissist or worse yet telling you that you're being paranoid, overreacting or some other way of blaming the victim. Unfortunately, asking advice from people who don't understand it can feel invalidating, lead you to more setbacks \& possibly even encourage you to stay in a dangerous situation.

It's terrifying when every part of your intuition is telling you something is really wrong but the covert narcissist \& everyone else are telling you that things are just fine, \& implying that maybe you are the problem.

Survivors of covert narcissists need to know that they're not crazy. This is the primary concern I hear from clients who were with covert types of abusers. Reading this book will give you that validation.

The recovery of self-trust after abuse by a covert narcissist can take some time. Be patient with yourself in this process. You have been through a severe relational trauma \& while you can't see your wounds, they are very real.

This book will help you to understand what happened in your relationship with a cover narcissist through an inventory of their typical characteristics \& behaviors, in addition to survivors' stories of interactions with them. You'll likely have many aha moments when you connect the dots to similar experiences that happened to you.

I know this book is going to help a lot of people make sense of the insensible.

Big hug to you!

\section*{Preface}

\begin{quotation}\it
	``Are you in a romantic relationship or coming out of one that feels incredibly confusing \& is making you feel like you're going crazy?
	
	Does your mother appear amazing to everyone else, but growing up you felt alone, found it hard to have your own identity, \& you felt like things were always your fault?
	
	Did you feel like you walked on eggshells growing up with your dad \& find it hard to connect with him, but people have always told you know lucky you are to have a dad like yours?
	
	Do you have a boss or coworker that everyone thinks is great, but after years of working with him\texttt{/}her, you find yourself feeling a lot of anxiety, never feeling good enough, \& questioning your own sanity?
	
	Has someone told you your loved one might be a narcissist? You've done some research but are confused because the person you are wondering about doesn't come across as a self-absorbed, arrogant over the top person that fits the description of a narcissist?
\end{quotation}
If any of these scenarios resonate, this could mean you are dealing with a covert narcissist. This is the hardest type of narcissist to diagnose because they are so disguised, so covert.

Covert narcissism is the worst \& most insidious form of narcissism because the abuse is so hidden. Most people don't even realize they are being abused when they are in these relationships. The life inside them is slowly depleted over time without them recognizing that this is a result of years of devaluing tactics by the narcissist. Their self-worth is beaten down. There are no visible scars, but the impact these people have on you is profound. You have been emotionally \& psychologically abused \& you are often the only one to see this side of them while everyone around them thinks they are great. This furthers your confusion \& minimizes your pain.

When I say ``worst form,'' I do not want to minimize anyone else's trauma when dealing with an overt narcissist or any other type of psychologically abusive personality. Abuse is abuse -- it is horrific \& always undeserved. My heart goes out to anyone who has \& is experiencing anything that harms \& devalues them.

1 reason covert narcissists are so damaging is because of cognitive dissonance. This is when you have 2 competing thoughts in your mind. You love your mom, spouse, boyfriend, or girlfriend \& thought they loved you the same. Yet when you look back, their behaviors are making you question your beliefs about them. As you research you begin to wonder, \textit{``Could this person really have been controlling \& manipulating me for years, \& I didn't see it $\ldots$ or were things really my fault \& I'm just overdramatizing my experience?''} You have a solid belief that has been built up over years that this is a good person who cares about you, \& at the same time, they are being incredibly cruel \& controlling. The cognitive dissonance is dizzying \& crazy making.

The overt types of narcissists are obvious, in your-face-face kind of people. They will let others know how great they are. When their mask comes off others around them roll their eyes \& say, \textit{``Oh, yeah, he's terrible.''}

On the other hand, covert narcissists are well liked. They are charming \& kind. They appear humble \& empathetic. They can be good listeners \& appear to really care. You can feel incredibly loved by them. They simultaneously make you feel terrible about yourself. They use cloaked tactics that you don't see for years.

It is common for people to be in romantic relationships with covert narcissists for over 10, 20, 30, 40-plus years not recognizing the abuse they have endured for decades.

This is especially devastating when it is a family member. Sometimes you are the only one who sees it when your siblings still think their dad or mom is amazing \& blame you for a plethora of things. You feel like you are going crazy \& you start minimizing the abuse yourself. If no one else sees it, you think it must be you that is the problem.

This type of abuse does not look as messy as it really is. It is so invisible. It is hard to put your finger on what is wrong.

If you relate to any of this, you are not alone, \& you can trust yourself.

I went through years of confusion \& cognitive dissonance myself. I have had several covert narcissists in my life. They have been incredibly confusing \& crazy-making relationships.

Years ago I searched for answers to help with my own confusion. I read a lot of books on narcissism but could not find any on the covert type. After years of piecing together information from various sources, I decided to write the book I had needed \& couldn't find so other survivors would have the information they needed in 1 place.

In preparation for this book, I interviewed over 100 survivors. I did in-depth research on the topic because I wanted to make sure this book would be accurate, comprehensive, \& incredibly helpful for you. You deserve that.

As I met more \& more people who have been through this type of relationship, my heart was affected tremendously. Witnessing their pain, their wounded hearts, \& their strength was humbling \& brought out a fierceness in me that made me want to make this the most helpful book I possibly could.

In the following pages, I will explain the traits of a covert narcissist. I share lots of stories from people I've interviewed to illustrate the traits. All the names have been changed \& details altered, so their identities are protected.

I facilitate a support group in my area \& have seen how important stories are. When I begin the meetings, I often ask what they are hoping to get out of the evening. Most people say, \textit{``Stories! I need to hear stories so I know I'm not crazy.''} You will hear plenty of stories in this book to help you recognize things you have experienced \& help validate the truth of what you have been through.

I also spend a lot of time talking about healing. If you have read this far, my hunch is you have probably been through or are going through a tremendously difficult \& crazy-making experience with a covert narcissist. You deserve to find clarity \& ultimately heal the wounds this relationship has caused.

Being with a covert narcissist can take you far away from the person you really are. My hope is this book will help bring you back to your stunning self.

May you find all the answers you are looking for \& come to a place of freedom \& peace. That may not feel possible right now, but trust me, it is.

With so much love,

Debbie Mirza'' -- \cite[pp. 9--12]{Mirza2017}

\section*{Introduction}

\begin{quotation}\it
	``Is your husband a narcissist?''
	
	``No! I would never use that word to describe him. He's the nicest guy. Everybody loves him. You would love him if you met him.''
	
	``Yes, that's what they are like.'' The divorce attorney saw Amy's confused face, walked closer to her \& said with concern, ``I am seeing a lot of classic signs, Amy. I suggest when you get home, you get a hold of as much information as you can about narcissists because you need to know what you're dealing with.''
\end{quotation}
Amy left the appointment in a daze. \textit{Narcissist?} That was the last word she would have used to describe her husband of over 30 years. She had always seem him as kind, someone she respected. Their relationship wasn't perfect, but most of the time she would have described it as a good marriage. She felt lucky to be with someone so easy going. However, his behavior over the past year had been vastly different than the man she thought she knew. So many things didn't make sense. The way he was treating her was so hurtful, disturbing, \& utterly confusing. Then suddenly, he was done with her. The ending of the marriage was shocking \& incredibly confusing.

When she 1st met her husband, she felt lucky to have met such a great guy. He was kind. He talked about his feelings. He listened to her, asked her questions about herself, really wanted to know her. Her family \& friends loved him, felt so happy she had met someone like him.

It was remarkable how alike they were. It all felt so easy. The 1st year they dated was pure bliss. Then things became difficult, but that was because of outside circumstances, she always believed. They worked through things. Their communication was great, she thought. They had some issues but always talked about things. She considered him her best friend.

Recently, though, he had been treating her in ways she had never experienced. This man she had seen as kind \& loving had become incredibly cruel \& aggressive toward her. He was continuously telling her all the things he believed was wrong with her \& blaming her for making it impossible for their marriage to work. All of this seemed to come out of nowhere. After 30 years, he moved out \& made sure she knew how much happier he was without her. It didn't seem to bother him at all that this was ending. He wanted out, \& according to him, it was all her fault.

She decided to take her attorney's advice, reading books as well as articles on narcissism, hoping this might be the piece that would finally make sense of this confusing puzzle.

When she read the descriptions of narcissists, she kept thinking, \textit{``that doesn't sound like him.''} Each book described someone who was flashy, drove expensive cars, liked to show off their fancy homes, people who were aggressive, annoying, obviously self-centered. She read stories of gaslighting that seemed really extreme to her. At the same time, amist the grandiose images, there were some things that did sound like her husband.

She read the basic traits of lack of empathy, rage, not a strong sense of self, controlling, manipulative, selfish. She began to feel like her eyes were opening to thins she had not seen previously.

Even though she believed her marriage was good, Amy had spent years doubting her self, believing she was to blame for issues that did arise in the marriage. Now, the way she was being treated felt wrong, even though she still wondered if the things he was saying about her were true. He seemed so confident \& sounded so rational. His words to her were cruel, but they were also mixed with loving words that made it even more confusing. When she was in conversations with him, her body felt confused, muddled, \& even nauseous at times. It was hard for her to think clearly. She felt run over \& talked down to by him. The words that came out of him were demeaning. He would ``teach'' her about life \& how she needed to be.

She found herself calling close friends \& family \& asking them questions like,
\begin{quotation}\it
	``Am I controlling \& manipulative like he's saying I am \& I just don't see it? Am I inconsiderate? Maybe I have been selfish? I can't think clearly. I can't even see what is true about me anymore?''
\end{quotation}
Feeling so confused, she needed reminders of who she really was because she felt like she was going crazy. While she was feeling incredibly emotional \& unstable, he was calm \& rational, which made her question herself even more.

Amy become a voracious reader \& researcher of narcissism. She also went to a therapist that was an expert on the subject. The therapist asked odd questions like:
\begin{quotation}\it
	``Did your husband forget things a lot, like when you would ask him to pick up some apples while he was at the store?''
	
	``Yes! About 70\% of the time.'' That's a trait?
	
	When he would go to a coffee shop I would ask if he could get me some water while he was in there. He would happily say `Sure!' About 7 out of 10 times he would come back to the car with no water \& say, `Oh! I'm so sorry. I totally forgot.' He seemed like he felt bad each time. I would always tell him it was okay. I felt frustrated \& confused because it happened so often, but I didn't feel like it was ok for me to be upset because it was an honest mistake.'' Is this common with narcissists?''
	
	``Yes. Very. Did he ever go back \& get you water?'' the therapist asked Amy.''
	
	``No. Never. I never thought about that.''
	
	``What about your birthdays? What were those like with him?''
	
	``They were awful. But the thing is I can't tell you exactly why.'' Amy's face scrunched up in confusion. ``He wasn't mean to me. He always bought me gifts. Sometimes took me out to dinner. For some reason, though, I ended up crying on my birthdays \& apologizing to him for something. I don't even remember why now. Maybe not being appreciative enough? He would buy me things, but many times they were things I wouldn't want. Then he would tell me a long story about how he found this gift \& all the thought \& effort that went into it, \& I would feel like I needed to have a big reaction even though it was something I never would have wanted. Then I'd feel bad because I was being shallow \& not grateful. Birthdays were always disappointing, \& I was glad when they were over. They wore me out for some reason. It never felt like he enjoyed celebrating me, treating me. He always seemed irritated that he had to do things for me. Sometimes he would spend a lot o money \& get me something grandiose. It actually stressed me out because of the amount of money he used. I didn't feel like I could say anything because of all the trouble he had gone to.''
	
	``When he gave you big things or made grandiose gestures, were other people around to see?''
	
	``Well, when I think about it, yes. Always $\ldots$ that's interesting. I never thought about that. I don't remember any private moments where he would give me something special that showed how well he knew me \& how much he loved me. I didn't feel loved on my birthdays when I look back.''
\end{quotation}
With each question, Amy realized she must learn more.

1 day, after telling her story to another therapist who had a lot of experience with narcissistic abuse, Amy heard a term she had not seen in her research, \& that changed everything for her. The therapist said, \textit{``It sounds like your husband is a Covert Passive-Aggressive Narcissist. Those are the hardest to recognize.''}

Amy felt chills go up her spine. \textit{``Please tell me more about that,''} she told the therapist. Everything began to make sense for the 1st time.

Hearing covert passive aggressive in front of the word narcissist gave her the missing piece she needed for her quest to understand what was happening. This sent her on a journey that would change her life forever, \& ultimately bring her the clarity \& healing she so desperately needed \& deserved. Amy now leads men \& women through different healing modalities in the mountains of Peru \& feels tremendously fulfilled \& happy. Years ago, when she 1st discovered the truth of her marriage, she never would have imagined that she would someday feel so free \& happy. She now has a glow about her that is inspiring \& gives others hope. She knows who she is \& has learned to trust herself implicitly.

Amy was 1 of the women I interviewed as part of my research for this book. Her story reflects what I heard from so many that have experienced the crazy-making relationship with a covert narcissist.

If you are reading this, I imagine you might relate to part of Amy's story, maybe even a lot of it. You may be on your own search, trying to make sense of a very confusing person in your life. This book is for you, to give you clarity, strength, \& understanding. It will educate you as well as give you hope.

The word ``narcissist'' is thrown around a lot \& grossly misused. \textit{``He's so narcissistic! Oh, yeah, I was with a narcissist too!''} People often use this word to describe someone who is selfish \& arrogant. The true definition goes much deeper \& unfortunately because it is used so carelessly, it diminishes the painful reality of victims of narcissistic people. Someone who has experienced a true narcissist would never toss the word around so lightly. It is important to know what it really means.

We tend to label people a lot, \& that can be a destructive thing. In this case, the label is important. When victims are looking for answers, \& they finally discover their partner or parent or co-worker might be a covert narcissist, everything begins to make sense. It is incredibly helpful in understanding \& beginning to heal.

I was talking about healing \& restoration to 1 survivor I interviewed. Through tears, she looked at me. With desperation \& shakiness in her voice, she asked, \textit{``Do you think it's even possible?''}

It is for this woman \& so many others like her that I have written this book. Profound healing \& freedom are absolutely possible. I, along with so many others, am proof of this. There is hope. The healing you will experience is profound \& will bring you to a very strong place inside yourself.

I also interviewed men who have experienced this abuse too. Both genders are affected by this destructive personality disorder.

Most people I talked to struggled to describe the relationship. This is common. There was a perpetual confused look on each face. It can be difficult to explain because the abuse is so hidden \& subtle. They weren't yelled at or physically abused. There are no visible scars. Yet the impact it makes on the psyche is profound.

Like the people I interviewed, I have also experienced covert narcissists, several actually. I know what it's like to be subtly abused for a very long time without recognizing it. I also know what it's like trying to find information on the covert type. You think you are on the right track after discovering narcissistic personality disorder, but then you read things that are not completely what you experienced. You read about aggressive behavior, physical abuse, dramatic stories of deception, \& you think maybe you are off track. Your story doesn't appear that bad compared to what you are reading, which then diminishes your own pain \& adds to your confusion. That's why I felt it was so important for me to write this book \& put everything I had learned into 1 place.

Many people who go to therapy to get help because they are depressed, low on energy, experiencing low self-esteem, feeling a lot of anxiety, \& confusion usually have no idea that the cause of their issue is an abusive relationship, whether that is with a romantic partner, a parent, or a boss at work.

Some victims become re-traumatized by a therapist or friend that doesn't understand. Most therapists are not educated on the covert type of narcissism. Only the overt type is taught in higher education, so most understandably don't recognize the signs \& traits. I talked to 1 woman who was in a covert relationship \& went to therapy for 10 years. She tried a few different therapists because no one seemed to be able to help her with her depression, anxiety, \& lack of energy. They didn't recognize she was in an abusive relationship. Finally, after 10 years, she tried another therapist who after 15 minutes told her she was in an abusive relationship. The others couldn't see it. Neither could she.

This is such a common story. She lived for years thinking something was wrong with her. She was being subtly manipulated \& devalued at home without seeing it. Her body was reacting. She was slowly dying inside \& couldn't figure out why. Thank goodness for the therapist who understood covert narcissism \& recognized the signs.

When the relationship ultimately ends in a breakup or divorce, victims have a very difficult time understanding what just happened. When a relationship with a covert narcissist ends, it is sudden \& painful. It can look like a ``normal'' divorce, but it is not even close.

Well-meaning friends \& family will wonder why it is so hard for you to get past the partner, why you have no desire to date anyone, why it is taking you so long to recover \& get back to the way you used to be. Breakups are a part of life, but this type of break up is a whole other animal. The only people that will fully understand what you are going through are those that have gone through it themselves.

You might be wondering whether you are on the right track when you picked up this book. You may wonder if you are being overly dramatic \& looking for someone to blame by thinking your ex or parent or co-worker might be a narcissist. Here's the thing. You're smart. I am sure the narcissist in your life has given you the opposite message about yourself, but the truth is some of the smartest people I've met are people who have been in relationships with covert narcissists.

A helpful thing to notice while you are trying to find answers is the fact that men \& women who are with healthy people don't enter words into online search engines such as toxic relationships; energy vampires; mean spouses; confusing relationships; hidden abuse; subtle abuse; manipulation; narcissism; covert narcissism; sociopaths. The same is true for people who are going through a divorce or a break up where they just realized they weren't a good match, or they fell out of love, or they find themselves wanting other things. If you are searching for answers because you feel utterly confused, you are on the right track because you're smart. If your body feels weak \& flustered around someone, it knows something is not right. If you feel like you are going crazy, you are not alone; this is a common feeling among survivors.

Trust your gut, your intuition, how your body feels. There is nothing wrong with you. You know more than you probably give yourself credit. You are a brilliant individual that has been beaten down, lied to, \& manipulated, so you naturally have a lot of self-doubts. That is normal \& completely understandable.

What you have been through is not a small thing. There are several types of narcissists. The covert type is 1 of the most destructive to your heart, psyche, \& physical body because it is so hidden, unrecognizable, \& you are usually the only one that sees it. People who know the narcissist in your life probably think they are 1 of the nicest people they've ever met \& often wish they could be as lucky as you to have a mom, husband, dad, wife, boyfriend, boss, or friend like you do. They feel the same way you did, maybe for a long time, about the covert narcissist in your life. They have experienced the same illusion, just not identified the truth.

When I was in the middle of my own confusion, searching for information \& understanding my eyes began to open. The more they opened, the more overwhelming grief \& anger I felt. With time, education, \& support, this awakening turned into a growing strength \& hope inside me. This will happen for you, too. Reading this book is going to be incredibly helpful for you as you begin to awaken to the truth of what you have been through.

Here is the truth. If you have lived with a covert narcissist, you have been held down for a long time. You have experienced the illusion of love, not the real thing. You have been lied to, manipulated, \& controlled. You have not been heard or valued. You were devalued \& brutally discarded by someone who said they cared about you, but in fact only cared about themselves. You have experienced a crazy-making relationship that is difficult to describe. Your self-confidence, your zest for life, your adventurous spirit, the light inside you has slowly dimmed; there is part of you that may not want to be here anymore but is cared to say that out loud or to anyone else. I understand. I've been there. This is incredibly common among survivors.

Here is the good news. You have begun a journey that will bring you to the truth you are seeking, the truth of what you have been through, \& the realization of how stunning \& valuable you actually are. With time, you will have clarity \& feel strength \& freedom that may be hard to comprehend right now, but trust me it's possible. You will experience love (the real thing this time), \& you will cherish every moment of it because of what you've been through. Your light will come back brighter than it's ever been. You will be able to love people \& help others in ways you couldn't have before. You will be free. Life will actually feel enjoyable, \& you'll be glad you're here. I promise you this is all possible.

I wrote this book for you, putting all the valuable information I have learned into 1 book to make it easier. I spent years researching for my own understanding \& healing. For this book, I decided to dive even deeper by reading more books, finding additional articles, listening to more YouTube videos, \& interviewing over 100 people around the world who have experienced a covert narcissistic wife, husband, mother, father, sister, brother, boss, boyfriend, girlfriend, or friend. I wanted to make this the most comprehensive, thorough, \& accurate book I could for you. The interviews were fascinating. Even though our stories were different, \& some of the relationship types were different, I found myself feeling like I was looking into a mirror when each person would tell me their story over Skype or across the table at a restaurant. These brave people furthered my motivation to get all this information down in 1 place.

I will be using stories from the people I've interviewed, but I have changed their names \& specific information to protect their identity. I will not be sharing who the narcissists are in my life. I also interviewed therapists \& life coaches who specialize in this area. They were extraordinarily helpful, \& I will share what I learned from them as well.

At the end of the book, there will be a list of helpful resources for you to do further study if you'd like.

This can feel like a lonely road since oftentimes you are the only one who ever sees this side of the narcissist. To give you a sense of how not alone you are, here is 1 statistic:
\begin{quotation}\it
	The World Narcissistic Abuse Awareness Day website \url{www.wnaad.com} estimates there are ``over 158 million people in the USA alone that are narcissistically abused by a person with either narcissistic personality disorder or anti-social personality disorder.'' The two have similar traits.
\end{quotation}
This is a massive problem that seems to be growing. 1 therapist I interviewed said she didn't know what was happening, but every person that has walked through her door in the past couple years is dealing with narcissistic abuse. Her appointments are constantly booked.

You are definitely not alone.

Meeting the people I've interviewed has made me discover a world out there I didn't know existed. When survivors find each other, there is an immediate connection, a feeling of safety, of understanding. We find ourselves enthusiastically nodding with relief when we hear each other's stories.

My intention for this book is to provide you with a tremendous amount of information as well as talking about different things you can do to heal.

I will be using 3 different terms when referring to a person who has experienced covert narcissistic abuse \& would like to explain my thoughts behind them.

If you have been the recipient of this crazy-making behavior, you were a target, a victim, \& are a survivor. The word ``victim'' can bring up reactions in people because we are warned against having a ``victim mentality.'' The truth is you were a victim. This doesn't mean that this needs to be a cloud that follows you the rest of your life. You were a person who was harmed. This is the direct definition of a victim. 

You were also a target, as hard as that is to believe \& accept. Covert narcissists seek out certain types of people. They look for people who are kind, authentic, self-reflective, nurturing, loving, \& caring people with a conscience. They look for energy supplies. Without these attributes, the narcissist has no use for you, \& their manipulative tactics wouldn't work for you.

You are also a survivor. You experienced subtle, manipulative abuse \& you are still here. Many people come out of these relationships not wanting to be here anymore after years of being emotionally beaten down. So the fact that you are still here, getting up every morning is something to be recognized \& commended. You are a survivor. You are stronger than you know.

My hope is this book will bring you the clarity \& understanding you want \& need.

Welcome to the beginning of your freedom.'' -- \cite[pp. 13--23]{Mirza2017}
