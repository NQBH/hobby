The answer is pretty surprising.

Across\footnote{\textbf{across} [prep] \textbf{1.} from 1 side to the other side of something; \textbf{2.} on the other side of something; \textbf{3.} on or over a part of the body; \textbf{4.} in every part of a place, group of people, etc., \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{throughout}; [adv] from 1 side to the other side; \textbf{across from somebody\texttt{/}something} [idiom] opposite somebody\texttt{/}something.} occupations\footnote{\textbf{occupation} [n] \textbf{1.} [countable] a job or profession; \textbf{2.} [uncountable] the act of moving into a country, town, etc. \& taking control of it using military force; the period of time during which a country, town, etc. is controlled in this way; \textbf{3.} [uncountable] the act of living in or using a building, room or piece of land; \textbf{4.} [countable] a way of spending time, especially when you are not working.}, if you examine\footnote{\textbf{examine} [v] \textbf{1.} to consider or study an idea or subject very carefully; \textbf{2.} to look at somebody\texttt{/}something closely, to see if there is anything wrong or to find the cause of a problem; \textbf{3.} \textbf{examine somebody} to give somebody a test to see how much they know about a subject or what they can do.} the link\footnote{\textbf{link} [v] [often passive] \textbf{1.} to make a physical or electronic connection between 1 object, machine or place \& another, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{connect}; \textbf{2.} to make or have a connection with somebody\texttt{/}something, especially where 1 thing affects the other; \textbf{3.} to state that there is a connection or relationship between 2 things or people, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{associate}; \textbf{link up (with somebody\texttt{/}something)} [phrasal verb] to join or become joined with somebody\texttt{/}something; [n] \textbf{1.} a connection between 2 or more people or things, especially where one affects the other; \textbf{2.} a relationship between 2 or more people, countries or organizations; \textbf{3.} a means of traveling or communicating between 2 places; \textbf{4.} (\textit{computing}) a place in an electronic document that is connected to another electronic document or to another part of the same document; \textbf{a link in the chain} [idiom] 1 of the stages in a process or a line of argument; \textbf{the weak link (in the chain)} [idiom] the point at which a system or an organization is most likely to fail.} between reciprocity styles \& success, the givers are more likely to become champs\footnote{\textbf{champ} [v] [intransitive, transitive] \textbf{champ (something)} (especially of horses) to bite or eat something noisily; \textbf{champing at the bit} [idiom] (\textit{informal}) impatient to do or start doing something; [n] an informal way of referring to a champion, often used in newspapers.} -- not only chumps\footnote{\textbf{chump} [n] (\textit{old-fashioned, informal}) a stupid person.}.''

As you can see, givers are more rare than takers \& matchers, \& have dramatically\footnote{\textbf{dramatically} [adv] \textbf{1.} in a very sudden or extreme way; to a very great degree; \textbf{2.} in a way that is exciting or impressive; \textbf{3.} using the style of a play in telling a story or giving an account of an event.} different performance\footnote{\textbf{performance} [n] \textbf{1.} [uncountable, countable] how well or badly you do something; how well or badly something works; \textbf{2.} [uncountable, singular] \textbf{performance of something} the action or process of performing a task or function; \textbf{3.} [countable] \textbf{performance (of something)} an act of presenting a play, concert or some other form of entertainment; \textbf{4.} [countable] an act of performing a song, a piece of music, or a role in a play or film.} results. While low-performing givers say yes to everything at the expense of their own work, which has a negative impact on their time management, project delivery, communication, \& execution in general, smart givers take into account what is best for the organization, not only what is best for the person asking for help. As a result, they are highly valued \& manage to both be helpful to their colleagues while positively impacting their organization.

In addition, givers may \href{https://nesslabs.com/how-to-build-a-support-group}{get more support} from fellow colleagues on their way up to success. ``There's something distinctive that happens when givers succeed: \fbox{it spreads \& cascades}. When takers win, there's usually someone else who loses. Research shows that people tend to envy successful takers \& look for ways to knock them down a notch. In contrast, when givers ($\ldots$) win, people are rooting for them \& supporting them, rather than gunning for them. Givers succeed in a way that creates a ripple effect, enhancing the success of people around them.''

In essence, successful givers generate win-win-win situations, where they succeed, their colleagues are elevated, \& the company performs better. Since givers can end up either at the lowest or the highest levels of performance, how can you make sure you are 1 of the most successful givers?

\subsection{How to Be A Smart Giver}
If your goal is moderate success, you can decide to act like a taker or a matcher. But if you want to be part of the top performing members of your organization, or to have a positive impact on the world \& foster win-win-win relationships with people around you, you may want to try to become a smart giver.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Change your mindset.} Consider the lens through which you are viewing your job \& your relationships with friends \& family. For your professional context, ask yourself who exactly is affected by your work? How do your choices impact the experience of colleagues \textit{\&} customers? How can you align your decisions so when you win, everyone wins? Instead of being self-focused like a taker or transactional like a matcher, think of an expanding pie where everyone can benefit from your success.
	\item \textbf{Help wisely.} A problem low-performance givers face is the \href{https://nesslabs.com/focused-mind}{lack of focus} on the way they give. Tracking your impact does not mean you need to become a taker \& only help when it benefits you, nor that you need to become a matcher \& only help when you receive equal value in return. Rather, it means that you need to make sure you are helping achieve goals that are beneficial in general, not only to the person you are helping. Ask yourself: is this good for the company, for the customers, for the team? In a personal context, ask: is this good for our group of friends, our family, or our relationship in general? If the answer is no, try to brainstorm a better solution.
	\item \textbf{Track your impact.} From time to time, \href{https://nesslabs.com/weekly-review}{block some time for self-reflection} to look back at past times you have helped, \& what the outcome was. In the end, who benefitted from your help? Was it just 1 person, who may have been a taker? Or did your help have a wider positive impact, which justifies the time \& energy you spent to provide your support? If you feel like your impact wasn't as positive as you expected, try to think of the factors at play, \& how you can be wiser next time you are asked for help so your involvement can be as beneficial as possible.
\end{itemize}
These strategies can be helpful for anyone, but especially for low-performing givers who are spending too much time \& energy on providing scattered support which negatively impact their own work \& relationships. Wherever you are on the spectrum of reciprocity styles, remember that it is a choice: you can practice wise generosity to become a smart giver \& create a positive ripple effect around yourself.'' -- \href{https://nesslabs.com/author/annelaure}{Anne-Laure Le Cunff}

\section{An Untrained \&\texttt{/}Thus (?) Failed Eidetiker: The Way I Remember}

\begin{remark}
	At the beginning, I am not so sure that this concept should be mentioned here, in the subject of psychology. But when I recalled back some pieces of my memory, I realize how serious \& devastated\footnote{\textsc{vi}: Hồi ức của 1 kẻ có trí nhớ điện tử. Cần phân biệt với bộ phim \href{https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0353969/}{IMDb\texttt{/}Memories of Murder} (2003), original title: Salinui chueok, i.e., Hồi ức kẻ sát nhân.} this ability has affected the development of my personality \& psychology in various aspects.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidetic_memory}{Wikipedia\texttt{/}eidetic memory}]
	``\emph{Eidetic memory} (more commonly called \emph{photographic memory} or \emph{total recall}) is the ability to recall an image from \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory}{memory} with high precision for a brief period after seeing it only once, \& without using a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_device}{mnemonic device}.''
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}[\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidetic_memory}{Wikipedia\texttt{/}eidetic memory}]
	``Although the terms \emph{eidetic memory} \& \emph{photographic memory} are popularly used interchangeably, they are also distinguished, with \emph{eidetic memory} referring to the ability to see an object for a few minutes after it is no longer present \& \emph{photographic memory} referring to the ability to recall pages of text or numbers, or similar, in great detail. When the concepts are distinguished, eidetic memory is reported to occur in a small number of children \& generally not found in adults, while true photographic memory has never been demonstrated to exist.'' \footnote{The word eidetic comes from the Greek word \textit{eidos} meaning ``visible form''.}
\end{remark}

\begin{question}
	Eidetic memory: A gift or a curse?
\end{question}

\subsection{Eidetic vs. Photographic}
From \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidetic_memory#Eidetic_vs._photographic}{Wikipedia\texttt{/}eidetic memory\texttt{/}eidetic vs. photographic}:

``The terms \textit{eidetic memory} \& \textit{photographic memory} are commonly used interchangeably, but they are also distinguished. Scholar Annette Kujawski Taylor stated,
\begin{quotation}
	``In eidetic memory, a person has an almost faithful mental image snapshot or photograph of an event in their memory. However, eidetic memory is not limited to visual aspects of memory \& includes auditory memories as well as various sensory aspects across a range of stimuli associated with a visual image.''
\end{quotation}
Author Andrew Hudmon commented:
\begin{quotation}
	``Examples of people with a photographic-like memory are rare. Eidetic imagery is the ability to remember an image in so much detail, clarity, \& accuracy that it is as though the image were still being perceived. It is not perfect, as it is subject to distortions \& additions (like episodic memory) \& vocalization interferes with the memory.''
\end{quotation}
``Eidetikers'', as those who possess this ability are called, report a vivid \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterimage}{after image} that lingers in the visual field with their eyes appearing to scan across the image as it is described. Contrary to ordinary mental imagery, eidetic images are externally projected, experienced as ``out there'' rather than in the mind. Vividness \& stability of the image begin to fade within minutes after the removal of the visual stimulus.

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Lilienfeld}{Lilienfeld} et al. stated,
\begin{quotation}
	``People with eidetic memory can supposedly hold a visual image in their mind with such clarity that they can describe it perfectly or almost perfectly $\ldots$, just as we can describe the details of a painting immediately in front of us with \fbox{near perfect accuracy}.''
\end{quotation}
By contrast, photographic memory may be defined as the ability to recall pages of text, numbers, or similar, in great detail, without the visualization that comes with eidetic memory. It may be described as the ability to briefly look at a page of information \& then recite it perfectly from memory. This type of ability--absolute recall of all events in a lifetime--has never been proven to exist.''\footnote{This appeared in the movie \href{https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119217/}{Good Will Hunting} (1997) mentioned in the quotes section.}

\subsection{Prevalence}
From \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidetic_memory#Prevalence}{Wikipedia\texttt{/}eidetic memory\texttt{/}prevalence}:

``\fbox{Eidetic memory is typically found only in young children, as it is virtually nonexistent in adults.} Hudmon stated, \textit{``Children possess far more capacity for eidetic imagery than adults, suggesting that a developmental change (e.g., acquiring language skills) may disrupt the potential for eidetic imagery.''}''

``It has been hypothesized that language acquisition \& verbal skills allow older children to think more abstractly \& thus rely less on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_memory}{visual memory} systems. Extensive research has failed to demonstrate consistent correlations between the presence of eidetic imagery \& any cognitive, intellectual, neurological, or emotional measure.''

``A few adults have had phenomenal memories (not necessarily of images), but their abilities are also unconnected with their intelligence levels \& tend to be highly specialized. In extreme cases, like those of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Shereshevsky}{Solomon Shereshevsky} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Peek}{Kim Peek}, memory skills can reportedly hinder social skills. Shereshevsky was \fbox{a trained \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonist}{mnemonist}, not an eidetic memorizer}, \& there are no studies that confirm whether Kim Peek had true eidetic memory.''

\subsection{Skepticism}
From \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidetic_memory#Skepticism}{Wikipedia\texttt{/}eidetic memory\texttt{/}skepticism}: [$\ldots$]

``Lilienfeld et al. stated:
\begin{quotation}
	``Some psychologists believe that eidetic memory reflects an unusually long persistence of the iconic image in some lucky people''. [$\ldots$] ``More recent evidence raises questions about whether any memories are truly photographic (Rothen, Meier \& Ward, 2012). Eidetikers' memories are clearly remarkable, but they are rarely perfect. Their memories often contain minor errors, including information that was not present in the original visual stimulus. So even eidetic memory often appears to be reconstructive''.
\end{quotation}
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeptical_movement}{Scientific skeptic} author \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Dunning_(author)}{Brian Dunning} reviewed the literature on the subject of both eidetic \& photographic memory in 2016 \& concluded that there is ``a lack of compelling evidence that eidetic memory exists at all among healthy adults, \& no evidence that photographic memory exists. But there's a common theme running through many of these research papers, \& that's that the difference between ordinary memory \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exceptional_memory}{exceptional memory} appears to be one of degree.''''

\subsection{Trained Mnemonists}
From \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidetic_memory#Trained_mnemonists}{Wikipedia\texttt{/}eidetic memory\texttt{/}trained mnemonists}:

``To constitute photographic or eidetic memory, the visual recall must persist without the use of mnemonics, expert talent, or other cognitive strategies. Various cases have been reported that rely on such skills \& are erroneously attributed to photographic memory.''

\begin{example}
	``An example of extraordinary memory abilities being ascribed to eidetic memory comes from the popular interpretations of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriaan_de_Groot}{Adriaan de Groot}'s classic experiments into the ability of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess}{chess} \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmaster_(chess)}{grandmaster} to memorize complex positions of chess pieces on a chessboard. Initially, Initially, it was found that these experts could recall surprising amounts of information, far more than nonexperts, suggesting eidetic skills. However, when the experts were presented with arrangements of chess pieces that could never occur in a game, their recall was no better than that of the nonexperts, suggesting that they had \fbox{developed an ability to organize certain types of information, rather than possessing innate eidetic ability}.
\end{example}
Individuals identified as having a condition known as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthymesia}{hyperthymesia} are able to remember very  intricate details of their own personal lives, but the ability seems not to extend to other, non-autobiographical information. They may have vivid recollections such as who they were with, what they were wearing, \& how they were feeling on a specific date many years in the past. Patients under study, e.g., \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Price}{Jill Price}, show brain scans that resemble those with \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive-compulsive_disorder}{obsessive-compulsive disorder}. In fact, Price's unusual autobiographical memory has been attributed as a byproduct of compulsively making journal \& diary entries. Hyperthymestic patients may additionally have depression\footnote{NQBH: a connection between eidetic memory \& depression.} stemming from the inability to forget unpleasant memories \& experiences from the past.\footnote{Exactly my case.} It is a misconception that hyperthymesia suggests any eidetic ability.\footnote{It seems to me that I possess both of these curses, although the latter is less obvious when I grow up: My memory is less sharp \& more messy (somehow the capacity of my memory seems to expand).}

Each year at the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Memory_Championships}{World Memory Championships}, the world's best memorizers compete for prizes. None of the world's best competitive memorizers has a photographic memory, \& no one with claimed eidetic or photographic memory has ever won the championship.''

\subsection{Notable Claims}
From \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidetic_memory#Notable_claims}{Wikipedia\texttt{/}eidetic memory\texttt{/}notable claims}:

``Main article: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_claimed_to_possess_an_eidetic_memory}{List of people claimed to possess an eidetic memory}.

There are a number of individuals whose extraordinary memory has been labeled ``eidetic'', but it is not established conclusively whether they use \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic}{mnemonics} \& other, non-eidetic memory-enhancement.

\begin{example}
	`Nadia', who began \fbox{drawing realistically} at the age of 3, is \fbox{autistic} \& has been closely studied. During her childhood she produced highly precocious, repetitive drawings from memory, remarkable for being in perspective (which children tend not to achieve until at least adolescence) at the age of 3, which showed different perspectives on an image she was looking at. E.g., when at the age of three she was obsessed with horses after seeing a horse in a story book she generated numbers of images of what a horse should look like in any posture. She could draw other animals, objects, \& parts of human bodies accurately, but represented human faces as jumbled forms.'' \footnote{Cf. my untrained drawing ability compared to a trained adult when I was a boy.}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
	Others have not been thoroughly tested, though savant \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wiltshire}{Stephen Wiltshire} can look at a subject once \& then produce, often before an audience, an accurate \& detailed drawing of it, \& has drawn entire cities from memory, based on single, brief helicopter rides; his 6-meter drawing of 305 square miles of New York City is based on a single 20-minute helicopter ride.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
	Another less thoroughly investigated instance is the art of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie_Bamara}{Winnie Bamara}, an Australian indigenous artist of the 1950s.
\end{example}

	Connection\emph{\texttt{/}}Correlation between eidetic memory \& gifted drawing ability?

		Will Graham: \textit{``I'm not psychic.''}
		
		Dr. Hannibal Lecter: \textit{``No, no, no, this is different; more akin to artistic imagination. You're able to assume the emotional point-of-view of other people, even those that scare or sicken you. It's a troubling gift, I should think.''}

\end{question}

\begin{question}
	What is the best status or feeling in life?

\begin{quotation}
	``He [G. H. Hardy] was, as I [C. P. Snow] later discovered, shy \& self-conscious\footnote{\textbf{self-conscious} [a] \textbf{1.} \textbf{self-conscious (about sth)} nervous\texttt{/}embarrassed about your appearance or what other people think of you; \textbf{2.} \textit{(often disapproving)} done in a way that shows you are aware of the effect that is being produced, \textit{opposite}: \textbf{unselfconscious}.} in all formal actions, \& had a dread of introductions. He just put his head down as it were in a butt of acknowledgment, \& without any preamble whatever began: $\ldots$'' [$\ldots$] ``I [C. P. Snow] half-guessed that he [G. H. Hardy] had a horror of persons, then prevalent in academic society, who devotedly studied the literature but had never played the game.'' [$\ldots$] ``He appeared to find the reply partially reassuring\footnote{\textbf{reassuring} [a] making you feel less worried or uncertain about something.}, \& went on to more tactical questions.'' [$\ldots$] ``As I had plenty of opportunities to realize in the future, Hardy had no faith in intuitions\footnote{\textbf{intuition} [n] \textbf{1.} [uncountable] the ability to know something by using your feelings rather than considering the facts; \textbf{2.} [countable] \textbf{intuition (that $\ldots$)} an idea or a strong feeling that something is true although you cannot explain why. \textsc{vi}: trực giác.} or impressions, his own or anyone else's. The only way to assess someone's knowledge, in Hardy's view, was to examine him. That went for mathematics, literature, philosophy, politics, anything you like. If the man had bluffed \& then wilted under the questions, that was his lookout. \fbox{1st things came 1st, in that brilliant \& concentrated mind.}'' [$\ldots$] ``Nothing else mattered. In the end he [G. H. Hardy] smiled with immense charm, with child-like openness, \& said that Fenner's (the university cricket ground) next season might be bearable after all, with the prospect of some reasonable conversation.'' -- \cite[Foreword, pp. 10--11]{Hardy1992}
	
	``I [C. P. Snow] don't know what the moral is. But it was a major piece of luck for me. This was intellectually the most valuable friendship of my life. His mind, as I have just mentioned, was brilliant \& concentrated: so much so that by his side anyone else's seemed a little muddy, a little pedestrian \& confused. He wasn't a great genius, as Einstein \& Rutherford were. He said, with his usual clarity\footnote{\textbf{clarity} [n] [uncountable] \textbf{1.} the quality of being expressed clearly; \textbf{2.} the ability to think about or understand something clearly; \textbf{3.} if a picture, substance or sound has clarity, you can see or hear it very clearly, or see through it easily.}, that if the word meant anything he was not a genius at all. At his best, he said, he was for a short time the 5th best pure mathematician in the world. Since this character was as beautiful \& candid\footnote{\textbf{candid} [a] \textbf{1.} saying what you think openly \& honestly; not hiding your thoughts; \textbf{2.} a \textbf{candid} photograph is one that is taken without the person in it knowing that they are being photographed.} as his mind, he always made the point that his friend \& collaborator Littlewood was an appreciably more powerful mathematician than he was, \& that his prot\'eg\'e\footnote{\textbf{prot\'eg\'e} [n] (feminine \textbf{prot\'eg\'ee}) \textit{(from French)} a young person who is helped in their career \& personal development by a more experienced person.} Ramanujan really had natural genius in the sense (though not to the extent, \& nothing like so effectively) that the greatest mathematicians had it.
	
	People sometimes thought he was under-rating himself, when he spoke of these friends. It is true that he was magnanimous\footnote{\textbf{magnanimous} [a] \textit{(formal)} kind, generous \& forgiving, especially towards an enemy or competitor.}, as far from envy as a man can be: but I think one mistakes his quality if one doesn't accept his judgment. I prefer to believe in his own statement in \textit{A Mathematician's Apology}, at the same time \fbox{so proud \& so humble}:
	\begin{quotation}
		`I still say to myself when I am depressed \& find myself forced to listen to pompous \& tiresome people, ``Well, I have done 1 thing you could never have done, \& that is to have collaborated with Littlewood \& Ramanujan on something like equal terms.'''
	\end{quotation}
	In any case, his precise ranking must be left to the historians of mathematics (though it will be an almost impossible job, since so much of his best work was done in collaboration). There is something else, thought, at which he was \fbox{clearly superior} to Einstein or Rutherford or any other great genius: \& that is at turning any work of the intellect\footnote{\textbf{intellect} [n] \textbf{1.} [uncountable, countable] the ability to think in a logical way \& understand things, especially at an advanced level; your mind; \textbf{2.} [countable] a very intelligent person.}, major or minor or sheer play, into a work of art. It was \fbox{that gift above all}, I think, which made him, almost without realizing it, purvey\footnote{\textbf{purvey} [v] \textit{(formal)} \textbf{purvey something} to supply food, services or information to people.} such intellectual delight\footnote{\textbf{delight} [n] \textbf{1.} [uncountable, singular] a feeling of great pleasure, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{joy}; \textbf{2.} [countable] something that gives you great pleasure, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{joy}.}. When \textit{A Mathematician's Apology} was 1st published, Graham Greene in a review wrote that along with Henry James's notebooks, this was the best account of what it was like to be a \fbox{\textit{creative artist}}\footnote{NQBH: a creative artist wannabe.}. Thinking about the effect Hardy had on all those round him, I believe that is the clue.'' -- \cite[Foreword, pp. 12--13]{Hardy1992}
