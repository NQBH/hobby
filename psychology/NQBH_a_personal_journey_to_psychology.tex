\section{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology}{Wikipedia\texttt{/}Psychology}}
``\textit{Psychology} is the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science}{scientific} study of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind}{mind} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior}{behavior}. Psychology includes the study of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness}{conscious} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconscious_mind}{unconscious} phenomena, including \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeling}{feelings} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought}{thoughts}. It is an academic discipline of immense scope, crossing the boundaries between the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_science}{natural} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science}{social sciences}. Psychologists seek an understanding of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence}{emergent} properties of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain}{brains}, linking the discipline to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience}{neuroscience}. As social scientists, psychologists aim to understand the behavior of individuals \& groups. $\Psi$ (or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psi_(Greek)}{psi}) is a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet}{Greek letter} which is commonly associated with the science of psychology.

A professional practitioner or researcher involved in the discipline is called a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychologist}{psychologist}. Some psychologists can also be classified as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioural_sciences}{behavioral} or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science}{cognitive scientists}. Some psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_behavior}{social behavior}. Other explore the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology}{physiological} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system}{neurobiological} processes that underline cognitive functions \& behaviors.

Psychologists are involved in research on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception}{perception}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition}{cognition}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention}{attention}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion}{emotion}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence}{intelligence}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(psychology)}{subjective experiences}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation}{motivation}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain#Function}{brain functioning}, \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_psychology}{personality}. Psychologists' interests extend to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship}{impersonal relationships}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_resilience}{psychological resilience}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_resilience}{family resilience}, \& other areas within \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_psychology}{social psychology}. They also consider the unconscious mind. Research psychologists employ \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_research}{empirical mehods} to infer \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality}{causal} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation}{correlational} relationships between psychological \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables}{variables}. Some, but not all, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology}{clinical} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counseling_psychology}{counseling} psychologists rely on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#Psychology_and_cognitive_science}{symbolic interpretation}.

While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment \& treatment of mental health problems, it is also directed towards understanding \& solving problems in several spheres of human activity. By many accounts, psychology ultimately aims to benefit society. Many psychologists are involved in some kind of therapeutic role, practicing \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy}{psychotherapy} in clinical, counseling, or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_psychology}{school} settings. Other psychologists conduct scientific research on a wide range of topics related to mental processes \& behavior. Typically the latter group of psychologists work in academic settings (e.g., universities, medical schools, or hospitals). Another group of psychologists is employed in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_and_organizational_psychology}{industrial \& organizational} settings. Yet others are involved in work on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_psychology}{human development}, aging, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_psychology}{sports}, health, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_psychology}{forensic science}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_psychology}{education}, \& the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_psychology}{media}.'' -- \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology}{Wikipedia\texttt{/}Psychology}

\subsection{Etymology \& Definitions}
``The word \href{https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/psychology}{\textit{psychology}} derives from the Greek word \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psyche_(psychology)}{psyche}, for spirit or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_(spirit)}{soul}. The latter part of the word ``psychology'' derives from $-\lambda{\rm o}\gamma\acute{\i}\alpha$ \href{https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-logia}{-logia}, which refers to ``study'' or ``research''. The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin}{Latin} word \textit{psychologia} was 1st used by the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia}{croatian} \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism}{humanist} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_latinistic_literature}{Latinist} \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marko_Maruli%C4%87}{Marko Maruli\'c} in his book, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psichiologia_de_ratione_animae_humanae}{\textit{Psichiologia de ratione animae humanae}} (\textit{Psychology, on the Nature of the Human Soul}) in the late 15th century or early 16th century. The earliest known reference to the word \textit{psychology} in English was by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Blankaart}{Steven Blankaart} in 1694 in \textit{The Physical Dictionary}. The dictionary refers to ``Anatomy, which treats the Body, \& Psychology, which treats of the Soul.''

In 1890, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James}{William James} defined \textit{psychology} as ``the science of mental life, both of its phenomena \& their conditions.'' This definition enjoyed widespread currency for decades. However, this meaning was contested, notably by radical \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism}{behaviorists} such as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_B._Watson}{John B. Watson}, who in 1913 asserted that the discipline is a ``natural science,'' the theoretical goal of which ``is the prediction \& control of behavior.'' Since James defined ``psychology'', the term more strongly implicates scientific \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment}{experimentation}. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_psychology}{Folk psychology} refers to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laity}{ordinary people}'s, as contrasted with psychology professionals', understanding of the mental states \& behaviors of people.'' -- \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology#Etymology_and_definitions}{Wikipedia\texttt{/}psychology\texttt{/}etymology \& definitions}

\subsection{History}
``Main article: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_psychology}{History of psychology}. The ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, China, India, \& Persia all engaged in the philosophical study of psychology. In Ancient Egypt the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebers_papyrus}{Ebers Papyrus} mentioned \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_depression}{depression} \& thought disorders. Historians note that Greek philosophers, including \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales}{Thales}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato}{Plato}, \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle}{Aristotle} (especially in his \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Soul}{De Anima} treatise), addressed the \fbox{workings of the mind}. As early as the 4th century BC, the Greek physician \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocrates}{Hippocrates} theorized that \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder}{mental disorders} had physical rather than supernatural causes. In 387 BCE, Plato suggested that the brain is where mental processes take place, \& in 335 BCE Aristotle suggested that it was the heart.

In China, psychological understanding grew from the philosophical works of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laozi}{Laozi} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius}{Confucius}, \& later from the doctrines of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism}{Buddhism}. This body of knowledge involves insights drawn from introspection \& observation, as well as techniques for focused thinking \& acting. It frames the universe in term of a division of physical reality \& mental reality as well as the interaction between the physical \& the mental. Chinese philosophy also emphasized purifying the mind in order to increase virtue \& power. An ancient text known as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huangdi_Neijing}{The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine} identifies the brain as the nexus of wisdom \& sensation, includes theories of personality based on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang}{yin-yang} balance, \& analyzes mental disorder in terms of physiological \& social disequilibria. Chinese scholarship that focused on the brain advanced during the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_Dynasty}{Qing Dynasty} with the work of Western-educated Fang Yizhi (1611--1671), \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Zhi_(scholar)}{Liu Zhi} (1660--1730), \& Wang Qingren (1768--1831). Wang Qingren emphasized the importance of the brain as the center of the nervous system, linked mental disorder with brain diseases, investigated the causes of dreams \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomnia}{insomnia}, \& advanced a theory of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateralization_of_brain_function}{hemispheric lateralization} in brain function.

Influenced by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism}{Hinduism}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_philosophy}{Indian philosophy} explored distinctions in types of awareness. A central idea of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upanishads}{\textit{Upanishads}} \& other \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedic_period}{Vedic} texts that formed the foundations of Hinduism was the distinction between a person's transient mundane self \& their \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80tman_(Hinduism)}{eternal, unchanging soul}. Divergent Hindu doctrines \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism}{Buddhism} have challenged this hierarchy of selves, but have all emphasized the importance of reaching higher awareness. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga}{Yoga} encompasses a range of techniques used in pursuit of this goal. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theosophy}{Theosophy}, a religion established by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Americans}{Russian--American} philosopher \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helena_Blavatsky}{Helena Blavatsky}, drew inspiration from these doctrines during her time in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj}{British India}.

Psychology was of interest to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment}{Enlightenment thinkers} in Europe. In Germany, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz}{Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz} (1646--1716) applied his principles of calculus to the mind, arguing that mental activity took place on an indivisible continuum. He suggested that the difference between conscious \& unconscious awareness is only a matter of degree. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Wolff_(philosopher)}{Christian Wolff} identified psychology as its own science, writing \textit{Psychologia Empirica} in 1732 \& \textit{Psychologia Rationalis} in 1734. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant}{Immanuel Kant} advanced the idea of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology}{anthropology} as a discipline, with psychology an important subdivision. Kant, however, explicitly rejected the idea of an \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_psychology}{experimental psychology}, writing that ``the empirical doctrine of the soul can also never approach chemistry even as a systematic art of analysis or experimental doctrine, for in it the manifold of inner observation can be separated only by mere division in thought, \& cannot then be held separate \& recombined at will (but still less does another thinking subject suffer himself to be experimented upon to suit our purpose), \& even observation by itself already changes \& displaces the state of the observed object.'' In 1783, Ferdinand Ueberwasser (1752--1812) designated himself \textit{Professor of Empirical Psychology \& Logic} \& gave lectures on scientific psychology, though these developments were soon overshadowed by the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars}{Napoleonic Wars}. At the end of the Napoleonic era, Prussian authorities discontinued the Old University of M\"unster. Having consulted philosophers \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Friedrich_Wilhelm_Hegel}{Hegel} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Friedrich_Herbart}{Herbart}, however, in 1825 \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussia}{the Prussian state} established psychology as a mandatory discipline in its rapidly expanding \& highly influential \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_education_system}{educational system}. However, this discipline did not yet embrace experimentation. In England, early psychology involved \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrenology}{phrenology} \& the response to social problems including alcoholism, violence, \& the country's crowded ``lunatic'' asylums.'' -- \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology#History}{Wikipedia\texttt{/}psychology\texttt{/}history}

\subsubsection{Beginning of experimental psychology}
\textsf{Fig. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Wundt}{Wilhelm Wundt} (seated) with colleagues in his psychological laboratory, the 1st of its kind.}

``Philosopher \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill}{John Stuart Mill} believed that the human mind was open to scientific investigation, even if the science is in some ways inexact. Mill proposed a ``mental \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry}{chemistry}'' in which elementary thoughts could combine into ideas of greater complexity. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Fechner}{Gustave Fechner} began conducting \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychophysics}{psychophysics} research in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig}{Leipzig} in the 1830s. He articulated the principle that human perception of a stimulus varies \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmically}{logarithmically} according to its intensity. The principle became known as the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber%E2%80%93Fechner_law}{Weber--Fechner law}. Fechner's 1860 \textit{Elements of Psychophysics} challenged Kant's negative view with regard to conducting quantitative research on the mind. Fechner's achievement was to show that ``mental processes could not only be given numerical magnitudes, but also that these could be measured by experimental methods.'' In Heidelberg, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_von_Helmholtz}{Hermann von Helmholtz} conducted parallel research on sensory perception, \& trained physiologist \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Wundt}{Wilhelm Wundt}. Wundt, in turn, came to Leipzig University, where he established th psychological \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory}{laboratory} that brought experimental psychology to the world. Wundt focused on breaking down mental processes into the most basic components, motivated in part by an analogy to recent advances in chemistry, \& its successful investigation of the elements \& structure of materials. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Flechsig}{Paul Flechsig} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Kraepelin}{Emil Kraepelin} soon created another influential laboratory at Leipzig, a psychology-related lab, that focused more on experimental psychiatry.

The German psychologist \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Ebbinghaus}{Hermann Ebbinghaus}, a researcher at the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Berlin}{University of berlin}, was another 19th-century contributor to the field. He pioneered the experimental study of memory \& developed quantitative models of learning \& forgetting. In the early 20th century, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Kohler}{Wolfgang Kohler}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Wertheimer}{Max Wertheimer}, \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Koffka}{Kurt Koffka} co-founded the school of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology}{Gestalt psychology} (not to be confused with the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_therapy}{Gestalt therapy} of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Perls}{Fritz Perls}). The approach of Gestalt psychology is based upon the idea that individuals experience things as unified wholes. Rather than \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism}{reducing} thoughts \& behavior into smaller component elements, as in structuralism, the Gestaltists maintained that whole of experience is important, \& differs from the sum of its parts.

Psychologists in Germany, Denmark, Austria, England, \& the United States soon followed Wundt in setting up laboratories. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._Stanley_Hall}{G. Stanley Hall}, an American who studied with Wundt, founded a psychology lab that became internationally influential. The lab was located at \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University}{Johns Hopkins University}. Hall, in turn, trained \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C5%ABjir%C5%8D_Motora}{Yujiro Motora}, who brought experimental psychology, emphasizing psychophysics, to the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_University_of_Tokyo}{Imperial University of Tokyo}. Wundt's assistant, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_M%C3%BCnsterberg}{Hugo M\"unsterberg}, taught psychology at Harvard to students such as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Nath_Sen_Gupta}{Narendra Nath Sen Gupta} -- who, in 1905, founded a psychology department \& laboratory at the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Calcutta}{University of Calcutta}. Wundt's students \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Dill_Scott}{Walter Dill Scott}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightner_Witmer}{Lightner Witmer}, \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_McKeen_Cattell}{James McKeen Cattell} worked on developing tests of mental ability. Cattell, who also studied with \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics}{eugenicist} \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Galton}{Francis Galton}, went on to found the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_Corporation}{Psychological Corporation}. Witmer focused on the mental testing of children; Scott, on employee selection.

Another student of Wundt, the Englishman \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Titchener}{Edward Titchener}, created the psychology program at \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University}{Cornell University} \& advanced ``\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuralism_(psychology)}{structuralist}'' psychology. The idea behind structuralism was to analyze \& classify different aspects of the mind, primarily through the method of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introspection}{introspection}. William James, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey}{John Dewey}, \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Carr}{Harvey Carr} advanced the idea of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_psychology}{functionalism}, an expansive approach to psychology that underlined the Darwinian idea of a behavior's usefulness to the individual. In 1890, James wrote an influential book, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Principles_of_Psychology}{The Principles of Psychology}, which expanded on the structuralism. He memorably described ``\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_of_consciousness_(psychology)}{stream of consciousness}.'' James's ideas interested many American students in the emerging discipline. Dewey integrated psychology with societal concerns, most notably by promoting \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_education}{progressive education}, inculcating moral values in children, \& assimilating immigrants.

A different strain of experimentalism, with a greater connection to physiology, emerged in South America, under the leadership of Horacio G. Pi\~nero at the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Buenos_Aires}{University of Buenos Aires}. In Russia, too, researchers placed greater emphasis on the biological basis for psychology, beginning with \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Sechenov}{Ivan Sechenov}'s 1873 essay, ``Who Is to Develop Psychology \& How?'' Sechenov advanced the idea of brain \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexes}{reflexes} \& aggressively promoted a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism}{deterministic} view of human behavior. The Russian-Soviet \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiologist}{physiologist} \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Pavlov}{Ivan Pavlov} discovered in dogs a learning process that was later termed ``\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning}{classical conditioning}'' \& applied the process to human beings.

\textsf{Fig. 1 of the dogs used in Pavlov's experiment with a surgically implanted \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannula}{cannula} to measure \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva}{salivation}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxidermy}{preserved} in the Pavlov Museum in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryazan}{Ryazan}, Russia.}'' -- \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology#Beginning_of_experimental_psychology}{Wikipedia\texttt{/}history\texttt{/}beginning of experimental psychology}

\subsubsection{Consolidation \& funding}
``1 of the earliest psychology societies was \textit{La Soci\'et\'e de Psychologie Physiologique} in France, which lasted from 1885 to 1893. The 1st meeting of the International Congress of Psychology sponsored by the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_of_Psychological_Science}{International Union of Psychological Science} took place in Paris, in Aug 1889, amidst \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposition_Universelle_(1889)}{the World
s Fair} celebrating the centennial of the French Revolution. William James was 1 of 3 Americans among the 400 attendees. The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Psychological_Association}{American Psychological Association} (APA) was founded soon after, in 1892. The International Congress continued to be held at different locations in Europe \& with wide international participation. The 6th Congress, held in Geneva in 1909, included presentations in Russian, Chinese, \& Japanese, as well as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto}{Esperanto}. After a hiatus for World War I, the 7th Congress met in Oxford, with substantially greater participation from the war-victorious Anglo-Americans. In 1929, the Congress took place at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, attended by hundreds of members of the APA. Tokyo Imperial University led the way in bringing new psychology to the East. New ideas about psychology diffused from Japan into China.

American psychology gained status upon the U.S.'s entry into World War I. A standing committee headed by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Yerkes}{Robert Yerkes} administered mental tests (``\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Alpha}{Army Alpha}'' \& ``\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Beta}{Army Beta}'') to almost 1.8 million soldiers. Subsequently, the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefeller_family}{Rockefeller family}, via the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Science_Research_Council}{Social Science Research Council}, began to provide funding for behavioral research. Rockefeller charities funded the National Committee on Mental Hygiene, which disseminated the concept of mental illness \& lobbied for applying ideas from psychology to child rearing. Through the Bureau of Social Hygiene \& later funding of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Kinsey}{Alfred Kinsey}, Rockefeller foundations helped established research on sexuality in the U.S. Under the influence of the Carnegie-funded \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics_Record_Office}{Eugenics Record Office}, the Draper-funded \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_Fund}{Pioneer Fund}, \& other institutions, the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics_in_the_United_States}{eugenics movement} also influenced American psychology. In the 1910s \& 1920s, eugenics became a standard topic in psychology classes. In contrast to the US, in the UK psychology was met with antagonism by the scientific \& medical establishments, \& up until 1939, there were only 6 psychology chairs in universities in England.

During World War II \& the Cold War, the U.S. military \& intelligence agencies established themselves as leading funders of psychology by way of the armed forces \& in the new \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Strategic_Services}{Office of Strategic Services} intelligence agency. University of Michigan psychologist Dorwin Cartwright reported that university researchers began large-scale propaganda research in 1939--1941. He observed that ``the last few months of the war saw a social psychologist become chiefly responsible for determining the week-by-week-propaganda policy for the United States Government.'' Cartwright also wrote that psychologists had significant roles in managing the domestic economy. The Army rolled out its new \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_General_Classification_Test}{General Classification Test} to assess the ability of millions of soldiers. The Army also engaged in large-scaled psychological research of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_A._Stouffer#Studies_in_Social_Psychology_in_World_War_II:_The_American_Soldier}{troop morale \& mental health}. In the 1950s, the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefeller_Foundation}{Rockefeller Foundation} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Foundation}{Ford Foundation} collaborated with the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency}{Central Intelligence Agency} (CIA) to fund research on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_warfare}{psychological warfare}. In 1965, public controversy called attention to the Army's \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Camelot}{Project Camelot}, the ``Manhattan Project'' of social science, an effort which enlisted psychologists \& anthropologists to analyze the plans \& policies of foreign countries for strategic purposes.

In Germany after World War I, psychology held institutional power through the military, which was subsequently expanded along with the rest of the military during \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany}{Nazi Germany}. Under the direction of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_G%C3%B6ring}{Hermann G\"oring}'s cousin \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthias_G%C3%B6ring}{Matthias G\"oring}, the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Psychoanalytic_Institute}{Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute} was renamed the G\"oring Institute. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freudian_psychoanalysis}{Freudian psychoanalysts} were expelled \& persecuted under the anti-Jewish policies of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Party}{Nazi Party}, \& all psychologists had to distance themselves from \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud}{Freud} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Adler}{Adler}, founders of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis}{psychoanalysis} who were also Jewish. The G\"oring Institute was well-financed throughout the war with a mandate to create a ``New German Psychotherapy.'' This psychotherapy aimed to align suitable Germans with the overall goals of the Reich. As described by 1 physician, ``Despite the importance of analysis, spiritual guidance \& the active cooperation of the patient represent the best way to overcome individual mental problems \& to subordinate them to the requirements of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volk}{Volk} \& the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemeinschaft_and_Gesellschaft}{Gemeinschaft}.'' Psychologists were to provide \textit{Seelenf\"uhrung} [lit., soul guidance], the leadership of the mind, to integrate people into the new vision of a German community. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harald_Schultz-Hencke}{Harald Schultz-Hencke} melded psychology with the Nazi theory of biology \& racial origins, criticizing psychoanalysis as a study of the weak \& deformed. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Heinrich_Schultz}{Johannes Heinrich Schultz}, a German psychologist recognized for developing the technique of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autogenic_training}{autogenic training}, prominently advocated sterilization \& euthanasia of men considered genetically undesirable, \& devised techniques for facilitating this process.

After the war, new institutions were created although some psychologists, because of their Nazi affiliation, were discredited. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Mitscherlich_(psychologist)}{Alexander Mitscherlich} founded a prominent applied psychoanalysis journal called \textit{Psyche}. With funding from the Rockefeller Foundation, Mitscherlich established the 1st clinical psychosomatic medicine division at Heidelberg University. In 1970, psychology was integrated into the required studies of medical students.

	\item \textbf{Givers.} On the other hand, givers will help whenever\footnote{\textbf{whenever} [conjunction] \textbf{1.} every time that; \textbf{2.} at any time that; on any occasion that.} the benefits to others exceed\footnote{\textbf{exceed} [v] \textbf{1.} \textbf{exceed something} to be greater than a particular number or amount; \textbf{2.} \textbf{exceed something} to go beyond what the law, an order or a rule says you are allowed to do; \textbf{3.} \textbf{exceed something} to be better than something, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{surpass}.} the personal costs. As Adam Grant explains: ``In the workplace\footnote{\textbf{workplace} [n] (often \textbf{the workplace}) [singular] a place where people work, such as an office or factory.}, givers are a relatively\footnote{\textbf{relatively} [adv] to a fairly large degree, especially in comparison with something else; \textbf{relatively speaking} [idiom] used when you are comparing something with all similar things.} rare breed. They tilt reciprocity in the other direction, preferring to give more than they get. Whereas takers tend to be self-focused, evaluating what other people can offer them, givers are other-focused, paying more attention to what other people need from them.''
	\item \textbf{Matchers.} Finally, matchers strive to preserve\footnote{\textbf{preserve} [v] \textbf{1.} \textbf{preserve something} to keep a particular quality or feature; \textbf{2.} to keep something safe from harm, in good condition or in its original state; \textbf{3.} to prevent something from decaying, by treating it in a particular way; [n] [singular] an activity, job or interest that is thought to be suitable for 1 particular person or group of people.} an equal balance\footnote{\textbf{balance} [n] \textbf{1.} [singular, uncountable] a situation in which all parts exist in equal or appropriate amounts; \textbf{2.} [countable, usually singular] the amount of money in a bank account; the amount of a bill that remains after part has been paid; \textbf{3.} [uncountable] the ability to keep steady with an equal amount of weight on each side of the body; \textbf{strike a balance (between A \& B)} [idiom] to manage to find a way of being fair to 2 opposing things; to find an acceptable position which is between 2 things; [v] \textbf{1.} [transitive, often passive, intransitive] to be equal in important or amount to something else that has the opposite effect, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{offset}; \textbf{2.} [transitive] \textbf{balance A with\texttt{/}\& B} to give equal importance to 2 different things or parts of something; \textbf{3.} [transitive, often passive] \textbf{balance a against B} to compare the importance of 2 different things; \textbf{4.} [transitive] \textbf{balance something} (\textit{finance}) to show or make sure that in an account the total money spent is equal to the total money received; \textbf{5.} [intransitive, transitive] \textbf{balance (something) (on something)} to put your body or something else into a position where it is steady \& does not fall.} between giving \& getting. ``Matchers operate\footnote{\textbf{operate} [v] \textbf{1.} [intransitive] to work, happen or exist, especially in a particular way or place at a particular time, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{function}; \textbf{2.} [transitive] \textbf{operate something} to use or control a system, process or machine; \textbf{3.} [intransitive] \textbf{operate (on somebody\texttt{/}something)} to cut open somebody's body in order to remove or repair a damaged part.} on the principle\footnote{\textbf{principle} [n] \textbf{1.} [countable] a law, rule or theory that something is based on; \textbf{2.} [singular] a general or scientific law that explains how something works or why something happens; \textbf{3.} [countable] a belief that is accepted as a reason for acting or thinking in a particular way; \textbf{4.} [countable, usually plural, uncountable] a moral rule or a strong belief that influences your actions; \textbf{in principle} [idiom] \textbf{1.} if something can be done in principle, there is no good reason why it should not be done although it has not yet been done \& there may be some difficulties; \textbf{2.} in general but not in detail.} of fairness\footnote{\textbf{fairness} [n] [uncountable] the quality of treating people equally or according to the law or rules.}: when they help others, they protect\footnote{\textbf{protect} [v] \textbf{1.} [transitive, intransitive] to keep somebody\texttt{/}something safe from harm or injury; \textbf{2.} [transitive, usually passive] to introduce laws that make it illegal to kill, harm or damage a particular animal, area of land, building, etc.; \textbf{3.} [transitive] to help an industry in your own country by taxing goods from other countries so that there is less competition; \textbf{4.} [transitive, intransitive] to provide somebody\texttt{/}something with insurance against fire, injury, damage, etc.} themselves by seeking\footnote{\textbf{seek} [v] \textbf{1.} [transitive] to ask for something from somebody, such as help or support; \textbf{2.} [transitive, intransitive] to try to obtain or achieve something; \textbf{3.} [intransitive] \textbf{seek to do something} to try to do something, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{attempt}; \textbf{4.} (\textbf{-seeking}) (in adjectives \& nouns) looking for or trying to get  the thing mentioned; the activity of doing this; \textbf{seek your fortune} [idiom] (\textit{literary}) to try to find a way to become rich, especially by going to another place; \textbf{seek somebody\texttt{/}something out} [phrasal verb] too look for \& find somebody\texttt{/}something, especially when this means using a lot of effort.} reciprocity.

The answer is pretty surprising.

($\ldots$) Givers dominate\footnote{\textbf{dominate} [v] \textbf{1.} [transitive, intransitive] \textbf{dominate (something\texttt{/}somebody)} to control or have a lot of influence over something\texttt{/}somebody, especially in a negative way; \textbf{2.} [transitive] \textbf{dominate something} to be the most important or obvious feature of something; \textbf{3.} [transitive, intransitive] \textbf{dominate (something)} to be the largest, highest or most common thing in a place.} the bottom \& the top of the success ladder\footnote{\textbf{ladder} [n] \textbf{1.} [usually singular] a series of stages by which you can make progress in your life or career; \textbf{2.} a piece of equipment for climbing up \& down something such as the side of a building, consisting of 2 lengths of wood or metal that are joined together by steps.}. Across\footnote{\textbf{across} [prep] \textbf{1.} from 1 side to the other side of something; \textbf{2.} on the other side of something; \textbf{3.} on or over a part of the body; \textbf{4.} in every part of a place, group of people, etc., \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{throughout}; [adv] from 1 side to the other side; \textbf{across from somebody\texttt{/}something} [idiom] opposite somebody\texttt{/}something.} occupations\footnote{\textbf{occupation} [n] \textbf{1.} [countable] a job or profession; \textbf{2.} [uncountable] the act of moving into a country, town, etc. \& taking control of it using military force; the period of time during which a country, town, etc. is controlled in this way; \textbf{3.} [uncountable] the act of living in or using a building, room or piece of land; \textbf{4.} [countable] a way of spending time, especially when you are not working.}, if you examine\footnote{\textbf{examine} [v] \textbf{1.} to consider or study an idea or subject very carefully; \textbf{2.} to look at somebody\texttt{/}something closely, to see if there is anything wrong or to find the cause of a problem; \textbf{3.} \textbf{examine somebody} to give somebody a test to see how much they know about a subject or what they can do.} the link\footnote{\textbf{link} [v] [often passive] \textbf{1.} to make a physical or electronic connection between 1 object, machine or place \& another, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{connect}; \textbf{2.} to make or have a connection with somebody\texttt{/}something, especially where 1 thing affects the other; \textbf{3.} to state that there is a connection or relationship between 2 things or people, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{associate}; \textbf{link up (with somebody\texttt{/}something)} [phrasal verb] to join or become joined with somebody\texttt{/}something; [n] \textbf{1.} a connection between 2 or more people or things, especially where one affects the other; \textbf{2.} a relationship between 2 or more people, countries or organizations; \textbf{3.} a means of traveling or communicating between 2 places; \textbf{4.} (\textit{computing}) a place in an electronic document that is connected to another electronic document or to another part of the same document; \textbf{a link in the chain} [idiom] 1 of the stages in a process or a line of argument; \textbf{the weak link (in the chain)} [idiom] the point at which a system or an organization is most likely to fail.} between reciprocity styles \& success, the givers are more likely to become champs\footnote{\textbf{champ} [v] [intransitive, transitive] \textbf{champ (something)} (especially of horses) to bite or eat something noisily; \textbf{champing at the bit} [idiom] (\textit{informal}) impatient to do or start doing something; [n] an informal way of referring to a champion, often used in newspapers.} -- not only chumps\footnote{\textbf{chump} [n] (\textit{old-fashioned, informal}) a stupid person.}.''

As you can see, givers are more rare than takers \& matchers, \& have dramatically\footnote{\textbf{dramatically} [adv] \textbf{1.} in a very sudden or extreme way; to a very great degree; \textbf{2.} in a way that is exciting or impressive; \textbf{3.} using the style of a play in telling a story or giving an account of an event.} different performance\footnote{\textbf{performance} [n] \textbf{1.} [uncountable, countable] how well or badly you do something; how well or badly something works; \textbf{2.} [uncountable, singular] \textbf{performance of something} the action or process of performing a task or function; \textbf{3.} [countable] \textbf{performance (of something)} an act of presenting a play, concert or some other form of entertainment; \textbf{4.} [countable] an act of performing a song, a piece of music, or a role in a play or film.} results. While low-performing givers say yes to everything at the expense of their own work, which has a negative impact on their time management, project delivery, communication, \& execution in general, smart givers take into account what is best for the organization, not only what is best for the person asking for help. As a result, they are highly valued \& manage to both be helpful to their colleagues while positively impacting their organization.

In addition, givers may \href{https://nesslabs.com/how-to-build-a-support-group}{get more support} from fellow colleagues on their way up to success. ``There's something distinctive that happens when givers succeed: \fbox{it spreads \& cascades}. When takers win, there's usually someone else who loses. Research shows that people tend to envy successful takers \& look for ways to knock them down a notch. In contrast, when givers ($\ldots$) win, people are rooting for them \& supporting them, rather than gunning for them. Givers succeed in a way that creates a ripple effect, enhancing the success of people around them.''

In essence, successful givers generate win-win-win situations, where they succeed, their colleagues are elevated, \& the company performs better. Since givers can end up either at the lowest or the highest levels of performance, how can you make sure you are 1 of the most successful givers?

\subsection{How to Be A Smart Giver}
If your goal is moderate success, you can decide to act like a taker or a matcher. But if you want to be part of the top performing members of your organization, or to have a positive impact on the world \& foster win-win-win relationships with people around you, you may want to try to become a smart giver.

For your professional context, ask yourself who exactly is affected by your work? How do your choices impact the experience of colleagues \textit{\&} customers? How can you align your decisions so when you win, everyone wins? Instead of being self-focused like a taker or transactional like a matcher, think of an expanding pie where everyone can benefit from your success.
	\item \textbf{Help wisely.} A problem low-performance givers face is the \href{https://nesslabs.com/focused-mind}{lack of focus} on the way they give. Tracking your impact does not mean you need to become a taker \& only help when it benefits you, nor that you need to become a matcher \& only help when you receive equal value in return. Rather, it means that you need to make sure you are helping achieve goals that are beneficial in general, not only to the person you are helping. Ask yourself: is this good for the company, for the customers, for the team? In a personal context, ask: is this good for our group of friends, our family, or our relationship in general? If the answer is no, try to brainstorm a better solution.
	\item \textbf{Track your impact.} From time to time, \href{https://nesslabs.com/weekly-review}{block some time for self-reflection} to look back at past times you have helped, \& what the outcome was. In the end, who benefitted from your help? Was it just 1 person, who may have been a taker? Or did your help have a wider positive impact, which justifies the time \& energy you spent to provide your support? If you feel like your impact wasn't as positive as you expected, try to think of the factors at play, \& how you can be wiser next time you are asked for help so your involvement can be as beneficial as possible.
\end{itemize}
These strategies can be helpful for anyone, but especially for low-performing givers who are spending too much time \& energy on providing scattered support which negatively impact their own work \& relationships. Wherever you are on the spectrum of reciprocity styles, remember that it is a choice: you can practice wise generosity to become a smart giver \& create a positive ripple effect around yourself.'' -- \href{https://nesslabs.com/author/annelaure}{Anne-Laure Le Cunff}

\section{An Untrained \&\texttt{/}Thus (?) Failed Eidetiker: The Way I Remember}

\begin{remark}
	At the beginning, I am not so sure that this concept should be mentioned here, in the subject of psychology. But when I recalled back some pieces of my memory, I realize how serious \& devastated\footnote{\textsc{vi}: Hồi ức của 1 kẻ có trí nhớ điện tử. Cần phân biệt với bộ phim \href{https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0353969/}{IMDb\texttt{/}Memories of Murder} (2003), original title: Salinui chueok, i.e., Hồi ức kẻ sát nhân.} this ability has affected the development of my personality \& psychology in various aspects.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidetic_memory}{Wikipedia\texttt{/}eidetic memory}]
	``\emph{Eidetic memory} (more commonly called \emph{photographic memory} or \emph{total recall}) is the ability to recall an image from \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory}{memory} with high precision for a brief period after seeing it only once, \& without using a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_device}{mnemonic device}.''
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}[\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidetic_memory}{Wikipedia\texttt{/}eidetic memory}]
	``Although the terms \emph{eidetic memory} \& \emph{photographic memory} are popularly used interchangeably, they are also distinguished, with \emph{eidetic memory} referring to the ability to see an object for a few minutes after it is no longer present \& \emph{photographic memory} referring to the ability to recall pages of text or numbers, or similar, in great detail. When the concepts are distinguished, eidetic memory is reported to occur in a small number of children \& generally not found in adults, while true photographic memory has never been demonstrated to exist.'' \footnote{The word eidetic comes from the Greek word \textit{eidos} meaning ``visible form''.}
\end{remark}

\begin{question}
	Eidetic memory: A gift or a curse?
\end{question}

\subsection{Eidetic vs. Photographic}
From \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidetic_memory#Eidetic_vs._photographic}{Wikipedia\texttt{/}eidetic memory\texttt{/}eidetic vs. photographic}:

``The terms \textit{eidetic memory} \& \textit{photographic memory} are commonly used interchangeably, but they are also distinguished. Scholar Annette Kujawski Taylor stated,
\begin{quotation}
	``In eidetic memory, a person has an almost faithful mental image snapshot or photograph of an event in their memory. However, eidetic memory is not limited to visual aspects of memory \& includes auditory memories as well as various sensory aspects across a range of stimuli associated with a visual image.''
\end{quotation}
Author Andrew Hudmon commented:
\begin{quotation}
	``Examples of people with a photographic-like memory are rare. Eidetic imagery is the ability to remember an image in so much detail, clarity, \& accuracy that it is as though the image were still being perceived. It is not perfect, as it is subject to distortions \& additions (like episodic memory) \& vocalization interferes with the memory.''
\end{quotation}
``Eidetikers'', as those who possess this ability are called, report a vivid \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterimage}{after image} that lingers in the visual field with their eyes appearing to scan across the image as it is described. Contrary to ordinary mental imagery, eidetic images are externally projected, experienced as ``out there'' rather than in the mind. Vividness \& stability of the image begin to fade within minutes after the removal of the visual stimulus.

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Lilienfeld}{Lilienfeld} et al. stated,
\begin{quotation}
	``People with eidetic memory can supposedly hold a visual image in their mind with such clarity that they can describe it perfectly or almost perfectly $\ldots$, just as we can describe the details of a painting immediately in front of us with \fbox{near perfect accuracy}.''
\end{quotation}
By contrast, photographic memory may be defined as the ability to recall pages of text, numbers, or similar, in great detail, without the visualization that comes with eidetic memory. It may be described as the ability to briefly look at a page of information \& then recite it perfectly from memory. This type of ability--absolute recall of all events in a lifetime--has never been proven to exist.''\footnote{This appeared in the movie \href{https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119217/}{Good Will Hunting} (1997) mentioned in the quotes section.}

\subsection{Prevalence}
From \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidetic_memory#Prevalence}{Wikipedia\texttt{/}eidetic memory\texttt{/}prevalence}:

``\fbox{Eidetic memory is typically found only in young children, as it is virtually nonexistent in adults.} Hudmon stated, \textit{``Children possess far more capacity for eidetic imagery than adults, suggesting that a developmental change (e.g., acquiring language skills) may disrupt the potential for eidetic imagery.''}''

``It has been hypothesized that language acquisition \& verbal skills allow older children to think more abstractly \& thus rely less on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_memory}{visual memory} systems. Extensive research has failed to demonstrate consistent correlations between the presence of eidetic imagery \& any cognitive, intellectual, neurological, or emotional measure.''

``A few adults have had phenomenal memories (not necessarily of images), but their abilities are also unconnected with their intelligence levels \& tend to be highly specialized. In extreme cases, like those of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Shereshevsky}{Solomon Shereshevsky} \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Peek}{Kim Peek}, memory skills can reportedly hinder social skills. Shereshevsky was \fbox{a trained \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonist}{mnemonist}, not an eidetic memorizer}, \& there are no studies that confirm whether Kim Peek had true eidetic memory.''

\subsection{Skepticism}
From \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidetic_memory#Skepticism}{Wikipedia\texttt{/}eidetic memory\texttt{/}skepticism}: [$\ldots$]

``Lilienfeld et al. stated:
\begin{quotation}
	``Some psychologists believe that eidetic memory reflects an unusually long persistence of the iconic image in some lucky people''. [$\ldots$] ``More recent evidence raises questions about whether any memories are truly photographic (Rothen, Meier \& Ward, 2012). Eidetikers' memories are clearly remarkable, but they are rarely perfect. Their memories often contain minor errors, including information that was not present in the original visual stimulus. So even eidetic memory often appears to be reconstructive''.
\end{quotation}
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeptical_movement}{Scientific skeptic} author \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Dunning_(author)}{Brian Dunning} reviewed the literature on the subject of both eidetic \& photographic memory in 2016 \& concluded that there is ``a lack of compelling evidence that eidetic memory exists at all among healthy adults, \& no evidence that photographic memory exists. But there's a common theme running through many of these research papers, \& that's that the difference between ordinary memory \& \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exceptional_memory}{exceptional memory} appears to be one of degree.''''

\subsection{Trained Mnemonists}
From \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidetic_memory#Trained_mnemonists}{Wikipedia\texttt{/}eidetic memory\texttt{/}trained mnemonists}:

``To constitute photographic or eidetic memory, the visual recall must persist without the use of mnemonics, expert talent, or other cognitive strategies. Various cases have been reported that rely on such skills \& are erroneously attributed to photographic memory.''

\begin{example}
	``An example of extraordinary memory abilities being ascribed to eidetic memory comes from the popular interpretations of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriaan_de_Groot}{Adriaan de Groot}'s classic experiments into the ability of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess}{chess} \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmaster_(chess)}{grandmaster} to memorize complex positions of chess pieces on a chessboard. Initially, Initially, it was found that these experts could recall surprising amounts of information, far more than nonexperts, suggesting eidetic skills. However, when the experts were presented with arrangements of chess pieces that could never occur in a game, their recall was no better than that of the nonexperts, suggesting that they had \fbox{developed an ability to organize certain types of information, rather than possessing innate eidetic ability}.
\end{example}
Individuals identified as having a condition known as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthymesia}{hyperthymesia} are able to remember very  intricate details of their own personal lives, but the ability seems not to extend to other, non-autobiographical information. They may have vivid recollections such as who they were with, what they were wearing, \& how they were feeling on a specific date many years in the past. Patients under study, e.g., \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Price}{Jill Price}, show brain scans that resemble those with \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive-compulsive_disorder}{obsessive-compulsive disorder}. In fact, Price's unusual autobiographical memory has been attributed as a byproduct of compulsively making journal \& diary entries. Hyperthymestic patients may additionally have depression\footnote{NQBH: a connection between eidetic memory \& depression.} stemming from the inability to forget unpleasant memories \& experiences from the past.\footnote{Exactly my case.} It is a misconception that hyperthymesia suggests any eidetic ability.\footnote{It seems to me that I possess both of these curses, although the latter is less obvious when I grow up: My memory is less sharp \& more messy (somehow the capacity of my memory seems to expand).}

Each year at the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Memory_Championships}{World Memory Championships}, the world's best memorizers compete for prizes. None of the world's best competitive memorizers has a photographic memory, \& no one with claimed eidetic or photographic memory has ever won the championship.''

\subsection{Notable Claims}
From \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidetic_memory#Notable_claims}{Wikipedia\texttt{/}eidetic memory\texttt{/}notable claims}:

``Main article: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_claimed_to_possess_an_eidetic_memory}{List of people claimed to possess an eidetic memory}.

There are a number of individuals whose extraordinary memory has been labeled ``eidetic'', but it is not established conclusively whether they use \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic}{mnemonics} \& other, non-eidetic memory-enhancement.

\begin{example}
	`Nadia', who began \fbox{drawing realistically} at the age of 3, is \fbox{autistic} \& has been closely studied. During her childhood she produced highly precocious, repetitive drawings from memory, remarkable for being in perspective (which children tend not to achieve until at least adolescence) at the age of 3, which showed different perspectives on an image she was looking at. E.g., when at the age of three she was obsessed with horses after seeing a horse in a story book she generated numbers of images of what a horse should look like in any posture. She could draw other animals, objects, \& parts of human bodies accurately, but represented human faces as jumbled forms.'' \footnote{Cf. my untrained drawing ability compared to a trained adult when I was a boy.}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
	Others have not been thoroughly tested, though savant \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wiltshire}{Stephen Wiltshire} can look at a subject once \& then produce, often before an audience, an accurate \& detailed drawing of it, \& has drawn entire cities from memory, based on single, brief helicopter rides; his 6-meter drawing of 305 square miles of New York City is based on a single 20-minute helicopter ride.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
	Another less thoroughly investigated instance is the art of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie_Bamara}{Winnie Bamara}, an Australian indigenous artist of the 1950s.
\end{example}

	Connection\emph{\texttt{/}}Correlation between eidetic memory \& gifted drawing ability?

		Will Graham: \textit{``I'm not psychic.''}
		
		Dr. Hannibal Lecter: \textit{``No, no, no, this is different; more akin to artistic imagination. You're able to assume the emotional point-of-view of other people, even those that scare or sicken you. It's a troubling gift, I should think.''}

	What? Why? \& How?
\end{question}

\begin{question}
	What is the best status or feeling in life?

\begin{quotation}
	``He [G. H. Hardy] was, as I [C. P. Snow] later discovered, shy \& self-conscious\footnote{\textbf{self-conscious} [a] \textbf{1.} \textbf{self-conscious (about sth)} nervous\texttt{/}embarrassed about your appearance or what other people think of you; \textbf{2.} \textit{(often disapproving)} done in a way that shows you are aware of the effect that is being produced, \textit{opposite}: \textbf{unselfconscious}.} in all formal actions, \& had a dread of introductions. He just put his head down as it were in a butt of acknowledgment, \& without any preamble whatever began: $\ldots$'' [$\ldots$] ``I [C. P. Snow] half-guessed that he [G. H. Hardy] had a horror of persons, then prevalent in academic society, who devotedly studied the literature but had never played the game.'' [$\ldots$] ``He appeared to find the reply partially reassuring\footnote{\textbf{reassuring} [a] making you feel less worried or uncertain about something.}, \& went on to more tactical questions.'' [$\ldots$] ``As I had plenty of opportunities to realize in the future, Hardy had no faith in intuitions\footnote{\textbf{intuition} [n] \textbf{1.} [uncountable] the ability to know something by using your feelings rather than considering the facts; \textbf{2.} [countable] \textbf{intuition (that $\ldots$)} an idea or a strong feeling that something is true although you cannot explain why. \textsc{vi}: trực giác.} or impressions, his own or anyone else's. The only way to assess someone's knowledge, in Hardy's view, was to examine him. That went for mathematics, literature, philosophy, politics, anything you like. If the man had bluffed \& then wilted under the questions, that was his lookout. \fbox{1st things came 1st, in that brilliant \& concentrated mind.}'' [$\ldots$] ``Nothing else mattered. In the end he [G. H. Hardy] smiled with immense charm, with child-like openness, \& said that Fenner's (the university cricket ground) next season might be bearable after all, with the prospect of some reasonable conversation.'' -- \cite[Foreword, pp. 10--11]{Hardy1992}
	
	``I [C. P. Snow] don't know what the moral is. But it was a major piece of luck for me. This was intellectually the most valuable friendship of my life. His mind, as I have just mentioned, was brilliant \& concentrated: so much so that by his side anyone else's seemed a little muddy, a little pedestrian \& confused. He wasn't a great genius, as Einstein \& Rutherford were. He said, with his usual clarity\footnote{\textbf{clarity} [n] [uncountable] \textbf{1.} the quality of being expressed clearly; \textbf{2.} the ability to think about or understand something clearly; \textbf{3.} if a picture, substance or sound has clarity, you can see or hear it very clearly, or see through it easily.}, that if the word meant anything he was not a genius at all. At his best, he said, he was for a short time the 5th best pure mathematician in the world. Since this character was as beautiful \& candid\footnote{\textbf{candid} [a] \textbf{1.} saying what you think openly \& honestly; not hiding your thoughts; \textbf{2.} a \textbf{candid} photograph is one that is taken without the person in it knowing that they are being photographed.} as his mind, he always made the point that his friend \& collaborator Littlewood was an appreciably more powerful mathematician than he was, \& that his prot\'eg\'e\footnote{\textbf{prot\'eg\'e} [n] (feminine \textbf{prot\'eg\'ee}) \textit{(from French)} a young person who is helped in their career \& personal development by a more experienced person.} Ramanujan really had natural genius in the sense (though not to the extent, \& nothing like so effectively) that the greatest mathematicians had it.
	
	People sometimes thought he was under-rating himself, when he spoke of these friends. It is true that he was magnanimous\footnote{\textbf{magnanimous} [a] \textit{(formal)} kind, generous \& forgiving, especially towards an enemy or competitor.}, as far from envy as a man can be: but I think one mistakes his quality if one doesn't accept his judgment. I prefer to believe in his own statement in \textit{A Mathematician's Apology}, at the same time \fbox{so proud \& so humble}:
	\begin{quotation}
		`I still say to myself when I am depressed \& find myself forced to listen to pompous \& tiresome people, ``Well, I have done 1 thing you could never have done, \& that is to have collaborated with Littlewood \& Ramanujan on something like equal terms.'''
	\end{quotation}
	In any case, his precise ranking must be left to the historians of mathematics (though it will be an almost impossible job, since so much of his best work was done in collaboration). There is something else, thought, at which he was \fbox{clearly superior} to Einstein or Rutherford or any other great genius: \& that is at turning any work of the intellect\footnote{\textbf{intellect} [n] \textbf{1.} [uncountable, countable] the ability to think in a logical way \& understand things, especially at an advanced level; your mind; \textbf{2.} [countable] a very intelligent person.}, major or minor or sheer play, into a work of art. It was \fbox{that gift above all}, I think, which made him, almost without realizing it, purvey\footnote{\textbf{purvey} [v] \textit{(formal)} \textbf{purvey something} to supply food, services or information to people.} such intellectual delight\footnote{\textbf{delight} [n] \textbf{1.} [uncountable, singular] a feeling of great pleasure, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{joy}; \textbf{2.} [countable] something that gives you great pleasure, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{joy}.}. When \textit{A Mathematician's Apology} was 1st published, Graham Greene in a review wrote that along with Henry James's notebooks, this was the best account of what it was like to be a \fbox{\textit{creative artist}}\footnote{NQBH: a creative artist wannabe.}. Thinking about the effect Hardy had on all those round him, I believe that is the clue.'' -- \cite[Foreword, pp. 12--13]{Hardy1992}
