	``[After reading \textit{In Sheep's Clothing}] I am beginning to reclaim my life, find my self-respect \& confidence.'' -- Marc, Virginia
	
	``After having read several books on several different self-help topics, psychology books, psychiatry books, etc., I MUST recommend you buy this one, 1st. It cuts straight through the bs -- neatly \& cleanly. I have bought copies of this book for friends \& can't recommend it enough.'' -- E. Adams, Online Purchaser
	
	``Don't Be Bossed-Around Ever Again!!! $\ldots$ \textit{In Sheep's Clothing: Understanding \& Dealing with Manipulative People} by George K. Simon, Jr., Ph.D., is a godsend to anyone who has ever questioned their own sanity while in any kind of relationship with a controlling \& manipulative person.'' -- The Aeolian Kid, Online Purchaser
	
	``Dr. Simon teaches the mechanics of popular tactics used by manipulators \& how you can identify \& thwart their attacks so that you control the outcome. This book helped me with a person that I have no choice but to see daily. After the end of every ``friendly'' conversation I felt depressed or insulted but could not figure out how this person was doing it. This book helped me to understand what was really happening. Dr. Simon's guidelines exposed this person \& [allowed me to take] control. Because this person knows [I] can be longer [be] controlled, I now have -- not a perfect relationship -- but one that's better than the alternative.'' -- A reader in Chicago
	
	``This book is like the secret decoder ring for the jumbled mess that is a manipulator's modus operandi. \textit{Do yourself a favor \& get this book now}.'' -- Christy, Missouri
	
	``It's sad that there are people out there that make life so much harder than it should have to be for others. Being able to identify such people in your life (both at home \& at work) is very important \& can be of invaluable help to (i) not go crazy oneself, \& (ii) take corrective action. Dr. Simon's book is written with amazing clarity. \textit{If you read only 1 book this year, read this one}.'' -- JA008, Online Purchaser
	
	``This is 1 of the best books I've ever read \& I would recommend it to anyone. It has redefined how I judge people \& helped me to become a stronger person. I used to be very naive \& unaware of people's ulterior motives, \& I have learned a tremendous amount from reading this book.'' -- S. Brescenti, Online Purchaser
	
	``This book makes it clear that evil is allowed free rein because of our ignorance of its nature. Simon shows us what seemingly mundane interactions that leave us perplexed may really be about. According to him, master manipulators leave us drained \& confused as we try to change them into the good person we want to believe they really are. I would add that the manipulators are just plain evil because evil requires lies, manipulation \& a weakening of the other's will through deception. Simon shows you how to recognize the signs \& what you can do about it. Good people are responsible for informing \& protecting themselves from the manipulators in society. This book is a necessary start.'' -- Kaye, a reader in New York state
	
	``Pithy \& often funny, George Simon takes the bluster \& obfuscation of overbearing, weasely bosses, nasty neighbors, \& obnoxious coworkers \& boils it down to show you the simple psychological strategies being used to imposed on your patience, good will, or even wallet. \textit{I have recommended this book to everyone I know \& bought extra copies for my kids} when they went out into the work world. Highly Recommended!'' -- C. MacCallum, Online Purchaser

\section{Acknowledgments}
``I am deeply grateful to my wife, Dr. Sherry Simon for her unfailing love, faith, understanding, patience, \& support. She is responsible for the title of this book \& was a valuable resource in helping me clarify my thoughts during its writing. I wish to thank Dr. Bruce Carruth for his critique of the original manuscript \& suggestions for making it more readable. I am deeply indebted to the work of Dr. Theodore Millon. His comprehensive approach to understanding personality has not only influenced my thinking on the subject but also proved invaluable in my efforts to help people change. I owe a supreme debt to the many individuals willing to share with me their experiences with manipulative people. They taught me much \& enriched my life. This book, in large measure, is a tribute to their courage \& support. I am most appreciative of the validation, support, \& enriching input consistently afforded me by workshop attendees. They have helped me clarity, refine, \& enhance 1 of my principal missions in life. Words cannot express the gratitude I have for the thousands of readers who have kept this book in the active lists of online booksellers \& retail outlets for over 15 years. The many emails, blog posts, \& letters readers have sent helped me make necessary updates \& changes to this Revised Edition. I have attempted to honor the considerable feedback I continue to receive by expanding the discussion of key concepts as well as introducing important new content for this newly revised edition. Finally, I want to thank Roger Armbrust \& Ted Parkhurst of Parkhurst Brothers, Inc., Publishers. Ted encouraged me at the outset \& was there when I needed him; Roger's grace \& presence have only benefited my work and readers.'' -- \cite[p. 7]{Simon2010}
