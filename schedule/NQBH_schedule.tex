\end{itemize}
All the blanks in the following schedule are filled with various personal journeys in Writing (both literary \& scientific), Reading (Psychology, Philosophy, etc.), Natural Science (Advanced Mathematics, Advanced Physics, Computer Science, etc.), \& naps\texttt{/}sleeps, obviously. The ultimate goal of these classes is a series of high quality articles \& books -- towards The Purity.
