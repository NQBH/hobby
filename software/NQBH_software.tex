\chapter{Markdown}

\section{\href{https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/markdown/}{Learn X in Y Minutes\texttt{/}Markdown}}
``Get the code: \href{https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/files/markdown.md}{markdown.md}. Markdown was created by \textsc{John Gruber} in 2004. It's meant to be an easy to read \& write syntax which converts easily to \textsc{html} (\& now many other formats as well). Markdown also varies in implementation from 1 parser to a next. This guide will attempt to clarify when features are universal or when they are specific to a certain parser.''

\subsection{HTML Elements}
``Markdown is a superset of \textsc{html}, so any \textsc{html} file is valid Markdown.
\begin{verbatim}
	<!--This means we can use HTML elements in Markdown, such as the comment element, & they won't be
	affected by a markdown parser. However, if you create an HTML element in your markdown file, you cannot
	use markdown syntax within that element's contents.-->''
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Headings}
``You can create \textsc{html} elements \texttt{<h1>} through \texttt{<h6>} easily by pretending the text you want to be in that element by a number of hashes (\verb|#|).
\begin{verbatim}
	# This is an <h1>
	## This is an <h2>
	### This is an <h3>
	#### This is an <h4>
	##### This is an <h5>
	###### This is an <h6>
\end{verbatim}
Markdown also provides us with 2 alternative ways of indicating h1 \& h2.
\begin{verbatim}
	This is an h1
	=============
	
	This is an h2
	-------------''
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Simple Text Styles}
``Text can be easily styled as italic or bold using markdown.
\begin{verbatim}
	*This text is in italics.*
	_And so is this text._
	
	**This text is in bold.**
	__And so is this text.__
	
	***This text is in both.***
	**_As is this!_**
	*__And this!__*
\end{verbatim}
In GitHub Flavored Markdown, which is used to render markdown files on GitHub, we also have strikethrough:
\begin{verbatim}
	~~This text is rendered with strikethrough.~~''
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Paragraphs}
``Paragraphs are a one or multiple adjacent lines of text separated by one or multiple blank lines.
\begin{verbatim}
	This is a paragraph. I'm typing in a paragraph isn't this fun?
	
	Now I'm in paragraph 2.
	I'm still in paragraph 2 too!
	
	
	I'm in paragraph three!
\end{verbatim}
Should you ever want to insert an HTML \verb|<br />| tag, you can end a paragraph with 2 or more spaces \& then begin a new paragraph.
\begin{verbatim}
	I end with two spaces (highlight me to see them).
	
	There's a <br /> above me!
\end{verbatim}
Block quotes are easy \& done with the \texttt{>} character.
\begin{verbatim}
	> This is a block quote. You can either
	> manually wrap your lines \& put a `>` before every line or you can let your lines get really long & wrap on
	> their own.
	> It doesn't make a difference so long as they start with a `>`.
	
	> You can also use more than one level
	>> of indentation?
	> How neat is that?''
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Lists}
``Unordered lists can be made using asterisks, pluses, or hyphens.
\begin{verbatim}
	* Item
	* Item
	* Another item
	
	or
	
	+ Item
	+ Item
	+ One more item
	
	or
	
	- Item
	- Item
	- One last item
\end{verbatim}
Ordered lists are done with a number followed by a period.
\begin{verbatim}
	1. Item 1
	2. Item 2
	3. Item 3
\end{verbatim}
You don't even have to label the items correctly \& Markdown will still render the numbers in order, but this may not be a good idea.
\begin{verbatim}
	1. Item 1
	1. Item 2
	1. Item 3
\end{verbatim}
(This renders the same as the above example)

You can also use sublists
\begin{verbatim}
	1. Item one
	2. Item two
	3. Item three
	    * Sub-item
	    * Sub-item
	4. Item four
\end{verbatim}
There are even task lists. This creates HTML checkboxes.
\begin{verbatim}
	Boxes below without the 'x' are unchecked HTML checkboxes.
	- [ ] 1st task to complete.
	- [ ] 2nd task that needs done
	This checkbox below will be a checked HTML checkbox.
	- [x] This task has been completed''
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Code Blocks}
``You can indicate a code block (which uses the \verb|<code>| element) by indenting a line with 4 spaces or a tab.
\begin{verbatim}
	    This is code
	    So is this
\end{verbatim}
You can also re-tab (or add an additional 4 spaces) for indentation inside your code
\begin{verbatim}
	    my_array.each do |item|
	        puts item
	    end
\end{verbatim}
Inline code can be created using the backtick character \verb|`|
\begin{verbatim}
	John didn't even know what the `go_to()` function did!
\end{verbatim}
In GitHub Flavored Markdown, you can use a special syntax for code
\begin{verbatim}
	```ruby
	def foobar
	    puts "Hello world!"
	end
	```
\end{verbatim}
The above text doesn't require indenting, plus GitHub will use syntax highlighting of the language you specify after the \verb|```|.''

\subsection{Horizontal Rule}
``Horizontal rules (\verb|<hr/>|) are easily added with 3 or more asterisks or hyphens, with or without spaces.
\begin{verbatim}
	***
	---
	- - -
	****************''
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Links}
``1 of the best things about markdown is how easy it is to make links. Put the text to display in hard brackets \texttt{[]} followed by the \textsc{url} in parentheses \texttt{()}
\begin{verbatim}
	[Click me!](http://test.com/)
\end{verbatim}
You can also add a link title using quotes inside the parentheses.
\begin{verbatim}
	[Click me!](http://test.com/ "Link to Test.com")
\end{verbatim}
Relative paths work too.
\begin{verbatim}
	[Go to music](/music/).
\end{verbatim}
Markdown also supports reference style links.
\begin{verbatim}
	[Click this link][link1] for more info about it!
	[Also check out this link][foobar] if you want to.
	
	[link1]: http://test.com/ "Cool!"
	[foobar]: http://foobar.biz/ "Alright!"
\end{verbatim}
The title can also be in single quotes or in parentheses, or omitted entirely. The references can be anywhere in your document \& the reference IDs can be anything so long as they are unique.

There is also ``implicit naming'' which lets you use the link text as the id.
\begin{verbatim}
	[This][] is a link.
	
	[this]: http://thisisalink.com/
\end{verbatim}
But it's not that commonly used.''

\subsubsection{Table of contents}
``Some Markdown flavors even make use of the combination of lists, links \& headings in order to create table of contents. In this case, heading titles in lowercase are prepended with hash (\verb|#|) \& are used as link ids. Should the heading have multiple words, they will be connected with a hyphen (\texttt{-}), that also replaces some special characters. (Some other special characters are omitted though.)
\begin{verbatim}
	- [Heading](#heading)
	- [Another heading](#another-heading)
	- [Chapter](#chapter)
	  - [Subchapter <h3 />](#subchapter-h3-)
\end{verbatim}
Nonetheless, this is a feature that might not be working in all Markdown implementations the same way.''

\subsection{Images}
``Images are done the same way as links but with an exclamation point in front!
\begin{verbatim}
	![This is the alt-attribute for my image](http://imgur.com/myimage.jpg "An optional title")
\end{verbatim}
And reference style works as expected.
\begin{verbatim}
	![This is the alt-attribute.][myimage]
	
	[myimage]: relative/urls/cool/image.jpg "if you need a title, it's here"''
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Miscellany}

\subsubsection{Auto-links}
\begin{verbatim}
	<http://testwebsite.com/> is equivalent to
	[http://testwebsite.com/](http://testwebsite.com/)
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Auto-links for emails}
\begin{verbatim}
	<foo@bar.com>
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Escaping characters}
\begin{verbatim}
	I want to type *this text surrounded by asterisks* but I don't want it to be
	in italics, so I do this: \*this text surrounded by asterisks\*.
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Keyboard keys}
``In GitHub Flavored Markdown, you can use a <kbd> tag to represent keyboard keys.
\begin{verbatim}
	Your computer crashed? Try sending a
	<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Del</kbd>''
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Tables}
``Tables are only available in GitHub Flavored Markdown \& are slightly cumbersome, but if you really want it:
\begin{verbatim}
	| Col1         | Col2     | Col3          |
	| :----------- | :------: | ------------: |
	| Left-aligned | Centered | Right-aligned |
	| blah         | blah     | blah          |
\end{verbatim}
or, for the same results
\begin{verbatim}
	Col 1 | Col2 | Col3
	:-- | :-: | --:
	Ugh this is so ugly | make it | stop
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Markdownlint}
``In order to simplify work with Markdown \& to unify its coding style, Markdownlint has been created. This tool is available also as a plugin for some IDEs \& can be used as an utility to ensure validity \& readability of Markdown.''
