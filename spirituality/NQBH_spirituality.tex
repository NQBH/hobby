\section{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality}{Wikipedia\texttt{/}Spirituality}}
``The meaning of \textit{spirituality} has developed \& expanded over time, \& various meanings can be found alongside each other. Traditionally, spirituality referred to a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion}{religious} process of re-information which ``aims to recover the original shape of man'', oriented at ``the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_of_God}{image of God}'' as exemplified by the founders \& sacred texts of the religions of the world. The term was used within early \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity}{Christianity} to refer to a life oriented toward the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Spirit_(Christianity)}{Holy Spirit} \& broadened during the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Middle_Ages}{Late Middle Ages} to include mental aspects of life.

In modern times, the term both spread to other religious traditions \& broadened to refer to a wide range of experience, including a range of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_esotericism}{esoteric traditions} \& religious traditions. Modern usages tend to refer to a subjective experience of a sacred dimension \& the ``deepest values \& meanings by which people live'', often in a context separate from organized religious institutions. This may involve belief in a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural}{supernatural} realm beyond the ordinarily observable world, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_growth}{personal growth}, a quest for an ultimate or sacred \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_of_life}{meaning}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_experience}{religious experience}, or an encounter with one's own ``inner dimension''.

``To the \textit{Circle of Fire}; those who have gone before, those who are present, \& those who have yet to come.''

\section*{The Toltec}
``Thousands of years ago, the Toltec were known throughout southern Mexico as ``women \& men of knowledge.'' Anthropologists\footnote{\textbf{anthropologist} [n] a person who studies anthropology}\,\footnote{\textbf{anthropology} [n] [uncountable] \textbf{1.} (also \textbf{cultural anthropology} or \textbf{social anthropology}) the study of the human race by comparing human societies \& cultures \& how they have developed; \textbf{2.} (also \textbf{physical anthropology}) the study of the human race by examining how humans behave \& how their bodies work \& have changed during their development.} have spoken of the Toltec as a nation or a race, but, in fact, the Toltec were scientists \& artists who formed a society to explore \& conserve the spiritual knowledge \& practices of the ancient ones. They came together as masters (\textit{naguals}) \& students at Teotihuacan, the ancient city of pyramids outside Mexico City known as the place where ``Man Becomes God.''

Over the millennia\footnote{\textbf{millennium} [n] (plural \textbf{millennia} or \textbf{millenniums}) \textbf{1.} a period of 1,000 years, especially as calculated before or after the birth of Christ; \textbf{2.} (\textbf{the millennium}) the time when 1 period of 1,000 years ends \& another begins.}, the \textit{naguals} were forced to conceal\footnote{\textbf{conceal} [v] to hide something.} the ancestral\footnote{\textbf{ancestral} [a] connected with or belonging to earlier members of a family, race of people or species.} wisdom\footnote{\textbf{wisdom} [n] \textbf{1.} [uncountable, singular] the ability to make sensible decisions \& give good advice, because of the experience \& knowledge that you have; \textbf{2.} [uncountable, countable] the knowledge \& experience that develops within a particular society or group of people. \textbf{(The) conventional\texttt{/}received wisdom} is what most people believe to be true. \textbf{Common, popular} \& \textbf{traditional} are also used in this way; \textbf{3.} [singular] \textbf{the wisdom of (doing) something} how sensible something is.} \& maintain its existence in obscurity\footnote{\textbf{obscurity} [n] (plural \textbf{obscurities}) \textbf{1.} [uncountable] the state in which somebody\texttt{/}something is not well known or has been forgotten; \textbf{2.} [uncountable, countable, usually plural] \textbf{obscurity (of something)} the quality of being difficult to understand; something that is difficult to understand.}. European conquest\footnote{\textbf{conquest} [n] \textbf{1.} [uncountable, countable] the act of taking control of a country, city, etc. by force; \textbf{2.} [countable] an area of land taken by force; \textbf{3.} [uncountable] \textbf{conquest of something} the act of gaining control over something that is difficult or dangerous.}, coupled with rampant\footnote{\textbf{rampant} [a] \textbf{1.} (of something bad) existing or spreading everywhere in a way that cannot be controlled, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{unchecked}; \textbf{2.} (of plants) growing thickly \& very fast in a way that cannot be controlled.} misuse\footnote{\textbf{misuse} [n] [uncountable, countable, usually singular] the act of using something in a dishonest way or for the wrong purpose, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{abuse}; \textbf{misuse something} to use something in the wrong way or for the wrong purpose, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{abuse}.} of personal power by a few of the apprentices\footnote{\textbf{apprentice} [n] a young person who works for an employer for a fixed period of time in order to learn the particular skills needed in their job; [v] [usually passive] (\textit{old-fashioned}) to make somebody an apprentice.}, made it necessary to shield the knowledge from those who were not prepared to use it wisely or who might intentionally\footnote{\textbf{intentional} [a] done deliberately, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{deliberate, intended}, \textsc{opposite}: \textbf{unintentional}.} misuse it for personal again.

Fortunately, the esoteric\footnote{\textbf{esoteric} [a] (\textit{formal}) likely to be understood or enjoyed by only a few people with a special knowledge or interest.} Toltec knowledge was embodied\footnote{\textbf{embody} [v] \textbf{1.} to express or represent an idea or a quality, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{represent}; \textbf{2.} \textbf{embody something} (\textit{formal}) to include or contain something.} \& passed on through generations by different lineages\footnote{\textbf{lineage} [n] [uncountable, countable] \textbf{1.} (\textit{formal}) the series of families that somebody comes from originally, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{ancestry}; \textbf{2.} (\textit{biology}) a set of species, each member of which is considered to have evolved from the one before. In biology, \textbf{lineage} is also used to talk about a set of cells which develop from a common cell.} of \textit{naguals}. Though it remained veiled\footnote{\textbf{veil} [v] \textbf{1.} \textbf{veil something\texttt{/}yourself} to cover your face with a veil; \textbf{2.} \textbf{veil something} (\textit{literary}) to cover something with something that hides it partly or completely, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{shroud}.}\,\footnote{\textbf{veiled} [a] \textbf{1.} a veiled threat, warning, etc. is not expressed directly or clearly because you do not want your meaning to be too obvious; \textbf{2.} wearing a veil ($=$ a piece of cloth worn to cover the face, hair, or head).} in secrecy\footnote{\textbf{secrecy} [n] [uncountable] the fact of making sure that nothing is known about something; the state of being secret.} for hundreds of years, ancient\footnote{\textbf{ancient} [a] \textbf{1.} belonging to a period of history that is thousands of years in the past, \textsc{opposite}: \textbf{modern}; \textbf{2.} very old; having existed for a very long time; \textbf{3.} (\textbf{the ancients}) [n] [plural] the people who lived in ancient times, especially the Egyptians, Greeks \& Romans.} prophecies\footnote{\textbf{prophecy} [n] (plural \textbf{prophecies}) \textbf{1.} [countable] a statement that something will happen in the future, especially one made by somebody who claims religious or magic powers. A \textbf{self-fulfilling prophecy} is a statement or theory about something that will happen in the future that itself causes the thing to happen.; \textbf{2.} [uncountable] the power of being able to say what will happen in the future.} foretold\footnote{\textbf{foretell} [v] (\textit{literary}) to know or say what will happen in the future, especially by using magic powers.} the coming of an age when it would be necessary to return the wisdom to the people. Now, don Miguel Ruiz, a \textit{nagual} from the Eagle Knight lineage, has been guided to share with us the powerful teachings of the Toltec.

Toltec knowledge arises from the same essential unity\footnote{\textbf{unity} [n] (plural \textbf{unities}) \textbf{1.} [uncountable, singular] the state of being joined together to form 1 unit; the state of being in agreement \& working together; \textbf{2.} [singular] a single thing that may consist of a number of different parts; \textbf{3.} [uncountable] (in art, literature, etc.) the state of looking or being complete in a natural \& pleasing way; \textbf{4.} [uncountable] (\textit{mathematics}) the number 1.} of truth as all the sacred\footnote{\textbf{sacred} [a] \textbf{1.} connected with God or a god \& thought to deserve special respect, \textsc{synonym}: \textbf{holy}; \textbf{2.} very important \& treated with great respect.} esoteric traditions found around the world. Though it is not a religion, it honors all the spiritual\footnote{\textbf{spiritual} [a] [usually before noun] \textbf{1.} connected with the human spirit, rather than the body or physical things, \textsc{opposite}: \textbf{material}; \textbf{2.} connected with religion.} masters who have taught on the earth. While it does embrace\footnote{\textbf{embrace} [v] \textbf{1.} \textbf{embrace something} to accept an idea, a proposal, a set of beliefs, etc., especially when it is done with enthusiasm; \textbf{2.} \textbf{embrace something} to include something; \textbf{3.} \textbf{embrace somebody} to put your arms around somebody as a sign of love or friendship.} spirit\footnote{\textbf{spirit} [n] \textbf{1.} [uncountable, countable] the part of a person that includes their mind, feelings \& character rather than their body; \textbf{2.} [singular, uncountable] an attitude or way of thinking; \textbf{3.} [uncountable, singular] loyal feelings towrads a group, team or society; \textbf{4.} [singular] \textbf{spirit (of something)} the typical or most important quality or mood of something; \textbf{5.} [uncountable] \textbf{spirit (of something)} the real or intended meaning or purpose of something; \textbf{6.} [uncountable] courage, determination or energy; \textbf{7.} [countable] \textbf{spirit (of somebody)} the part of a person that many people believe still exists after their body is dead; \textbf{8.} [countable] an imaginary creature with magic powers; \textbf{9.} [countable, usually plural] (\textit{especially British English}) a strong alcoholic drink.}, it is most accurately\footnote{\textbf{accurately} [adv] in a way that is true \& exact, \textsc{opposite}: \textbf{inaccurately}.} described as a way of life, distinguished by the ready accessibility\footnote{\textbf{accessibility} [n] [uncountable] the quality of being easy to reach, enter, use or obtain.} of happiness \& love.'' -- \cite[The Toltec]{Ruiz2011}
