\section*{The Toltec}
``Thousands of years ago, the Toltec were known throughout southern Mexico as ``women \& men of knowledge.'' Anthropologists have spoken of the Toltec as a nation or a race, but, in fact, the Toltec were scientists \& artists who formed a society to explore \& conserve the spiritual knowledge \& practices of the ancient ones. They came together as masters (\textit{naguals}) \& students at Teotihuacan, the ancient city of pyramids outside Mexico City known as the place where ``Man becomes God.'' Over the millennia, the \textit{naguals} were forced to conceal the ancestral wisdom \& maintain its existence in obscurity. European conquest, coupled with rampant misuse of personal power by a few of the apprentices, made it necessary to shield the knowledge from those were not prepared to use it widely or who might intentionally misuse it for personal gain.

Fortunately, the esoteric Toltec knowledge was embodied \& passed on through generations by different lineagues of \textit{naguals}. Though it remained veiled in secrecy for hundreds of years, ancient prophecies foretold the coming of an age when it would be necessary to return the wisdom to the people. Now, don Miguel Ruiz \& don Jose Ruiz (\textit{naguals} from the Eagle Knight lineague) have been guided to share with us the powerful teachings of the Toltec.

Toltec wisdom arises from the same essential unity of truth as all the sacred esoteric traditions found around the world. Though it is not a religion, it honors all the spiritual masters who have taught on the earth. While it does embrace spirit, it is most accurately described as a way of life, distinguished by the ready accessibility of happiness \& love.'' -- \cite[p. 12]{Ruiz_Ruiz2011}

\section{Introduction}

\begin{flushright}
	by don Miguel Ruiz
\end{flushright}
``The 4 Agreements was published many years ago. If you have read the book, you already know what these agreements can do. They have the ability to transform your life by breaking thousands of limiting agreements you have made with yourself, with other people, with \textit{life} itself.

The 1st time you read \textit{The 4 Agreements}, it begins to work its magic. It goes much deeper than the words you are reading. You feel that you already know every word in the book. You feel it, but perhaps you never put it into words. When you read the book the 1st time, it challenges what you believe, \& takes you to the limit of your comprehension. You break many limiting agreements, \& overcome many challenges, but then you see new challenges. When you read the book a 2nd time, it feels as if you're reading a completely different book because the limits of your comprehension have already grown. Once again, it takes you into a deeper awareness of yourself, \& you reach the limit that you can reach in that moment. \& when you read the book a 3rd time, it's just as if you're reading another book.

Just like magic, because they \textit{are} magic, the 4 Agreements slowly help you to recover your authentic self. With practice, these 4 simple agreements take you to what you \textit{really} are, not what you pretend to be, \& this is exactly where you want to be: what you really are.

The principles in \textit{The 4 Agreements} speak to the heart of all human beings, from the young to the old. They speak to people of different cultures all around the world -- people who speak different languages, people whose religious \& philosophical beliefs are vastly different. They have been taught at different kinds of schools, from elementary schools to secondary schools to universities. The principles in \textit{The 4 Agreements} reach everyone because they are pure common sense.

Now it's time to give another gift: \textit{The 5th Agreement}. The 5th agreement wasn't included in my 1st book because the 1st 4 agreements were enough of a challenge at that time. The 5th agreement is made with words, of course, but its meaning \& intent is beyond the words. The 5th agreement is ultimately about seeing your whole reality with the eyes of truth, \textit{without} words. The result of practicing the 5th agreement is the complete acceptance of yourself just the way you are, \& the complete acceptance of everybody else just the way they are. The reward is your eternal happiness.

Many years ago, I began teaching some of the concepts in this book to my apprentices, but then I stopped because nobody seemed to understand what I was trying to say. Though I had shared the 5th agreement with my apprentices, I discovered that nobody was ready to learn the teachings that underlie this agreement. Years later, my son, don Jose, started to share the same teachings with a group of students, \& he succeeded where I had failed. Maybe the reason don Jose was successful was because he had complete faith in sharing the message. His very presence spoke the truth \& challenged the beliefs of the people who attended his classes. He made a huge difference in their lives.

Don Jose Ruiz has been my apprentice since he was a child, since he learned to speak. In this book, I am honored to introduce my son, \& to present the essence of the teachings we delivered together over a period of 7 years.

To keep the messages as personal as possible, \& keeping with the 1st-person voice of prior books in the Toltec Wisdom series, we have opted to present \textit{The 5th Agreement} in the same 1st-person style of writing. In this book, we speak to the reader with 1 voice, \& with 1 heart.'' -- \cite[pp. 14--15]{Ruiz_Ruiz2011}
