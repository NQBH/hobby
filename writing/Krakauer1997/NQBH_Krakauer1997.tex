\section{Quotes}
See \cite{Krakauer1997}.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item ``Happiness [is] only real when shared.''
	\item ``It's not always necessary to be strong, but to feel strong.''
	\item ``make a radical change in your lifestyle \& begin to boldly do things which you may previously never have thought of doing, or been too hesitant to attempt. So many people live within unhappy circumstances \& yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, \& conservation, all of which may appear to give 1 peace of mind, but in reality nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future. The very basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, \& hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new \& different sun. If you want to get more out of life, you must lose your inclination for monotonous security \& adopt a helter-skelter style of life that will at 1st appear to you to be crazy. But once you become accustomed to such a life you will see its full meaning \& its incredible beauty.''
\end{enumerate}
