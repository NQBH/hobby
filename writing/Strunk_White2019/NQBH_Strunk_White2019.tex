%------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\section{An Approach to Style (With a List of Reminders)}

\subsection{Place yourself in the background.}
``Write in a way that draws the reader's attention to the sense \& substance of the writing, rather than to the mood \& temper of the author. If the writing is solid \& good, the mood \& temper of the writer will eventually be revealed \& not at the expense of the work. Therefore, the 1st piece of advice is this: to achieve style, begin by affecting none -- i.e., place yourself in the background. A careful \& honest writer does not need to worry about style. As you become proficient in the use of language, your style will emerge, because you yourself will emerge, \& when this happens you will find it increasingly easy to break through the barriers that separate you from other minds, other hearts -- which is, of course, the purpose of writing, as well as its principal reward. Fortunately, the act of composition, or creation, disciplines the mind; writing is 1 way to go about thinking, \& the practice \& habit of writing not only drain the mind but supply it, too.'' -- \cite[p. 78]{Strunk_White2019}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\subsection{Write in a way that comes naturally.}
``Write in a way that comes easily \& naturally to you, using words \& phrases that come readily to hand. But do not assume that becaues you have acted naturally your product is without flaw.

The use of language begins with imitation. The infant imitates the sounds made by its parents; the child imitates 1st the spoken language, then the stuff of books. The imitative life continues long after the writer is secure in the language, for it is almost impossible to avoid imitating what one admires. Never imitate consciously, but do not worry about being an imitator; take pains instead to admire what is good. Then when you write in a way that comes naturally, you will echo the halloos that bear repeating.'' -- \cite[p. 79]{Strunk_White2019}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\subsection{Work from a suitable design.}
``Before beginning to compose something, gauge the nature \& extent of the enterprise \& work from a suitable design. (See Chap. II, Rule 12.) Design informs even the simplest structure, whether of brick \& steel or of prose. You raise a pup tent from 1 sort of vision, a cathedral from another. This does not mean that you must sit with a blueprint always in front of you, merely that you had best anticipate what you are getting into. To compose a laundry list, you can work directly from the pile of soiled garments, ticking them off 1 by 1. By to write a biography, you will need at least a rough scheme; you cannot plunge in blindly \& start ticking off fact after fact about your subject, lest you miss the forest for the trees \& there be no end to your labors.

Sometimes, of course, impulse \& emotion are more compelling than design. If you are deeply troubled \& are composing a letter appealing for mercy or for love, you had best not attempt to organize your emotions; the prose will have a better chance if the emotions are left in disarray -- which you'll probably have to do anyway, since feelings do not usually lend themselves to rearrangement. But even the kind of writing that is essentially adventurous \& impetuous will on examination be found to have a secret plan: Columbus didn't just sail, he sailed west, \& the New World took shape from this simple \&, we now think, sensible design.'' -- \cite[p. 80]{Strunk_White2019}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\subsection{Write with nouns \& verbs.}
``Write with nouns \& verbs, not with adjectives \& adverbs. The adjective hasn't been built that can pull a weak or inaccurate noun out of a tight place. This is not to disparage adjectives \& adverbs; they are indispensable parts of speech. Occasionally they surprise us with their power, as in
\begin{quotation}\it
	Up the airy mountain,
	
	Down the rushy glen,
	
	We daren't go a-hunting
	
	For fear of little men $\ldots$
\end{quotation}
The nouns \textit{mountain} \& \textit{glen} are accurate enough, but had the mountain not become airy, the glen rushy, William Ailing-ham might never have got off the ground with this poem. In general, however, it is nouns \& verbs, not their assistants, that give good writing its toughness \& color.'' -- \cite[p. 81]{Strunk_White2019}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\subsection{Revise \& rewrite.}
``Revising is part of writing. Few writers are so expert that they can produce what they are after on the 1st try. Quite often you will discover, on examining the completed work, that there are serious flaws in the arrangement of the material, calling for transpositions. When this is the case, a word processor can save you time \& labor as you rearrange the manuscript. You can select material on your screen \& move it to a more appropriate spot, or, if you cannot find the right spot, you can move the material to the end of the manuscript until you decide whether to delete it. Some writers find that working with a printed copy of the manuscript helps them to visualize the process of change; others prefer to revise entirely on screen. Above all, do not be afraid to experiment with what you have written. Save both the original \& the revised versions; you can always use the computer to restore the manuscript to its original condition, should that course seem best. Remember, it is no sign of weakness or defeat that your manuscript ends up in need of major surgery. This is a common occurrence in all writing, \& among the best writers.'' -- \cite[p. 82]{Strunk_White2019}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\subsection{Do not overwrite.}
``Rich, ornate prose is hard to digest, generally unwholesome, \& sometimes nauseating. If the sickly-sweet word, the overblown phrase are your natural form of expression, as is sometimes the case, you will have to compensate for it by a show of vigor, \& by writing something as meritorious as the Songs of Songs, which is Solomon's.

When writing with a computer, you must guard against wordiness. The click \& flow of a word processor can be seductive, \& you may find yourself adding a few unnecessary words or even a whole passage just to experience the pleasure of running your fingers over the keyboard \& watching your words appear on the screen. It is always a good idea to reread your writing later \& ruthlessly delete the excess.'' -- \cite[p. 83]{Strunk_White2019}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\subsection{Do not overstate.}
``When you overstate, readers will be instantly on guard, \& everything that has preceded your overstatement as well as everything that follows it will be suspect in their minds because they have lost confidence in your judgment or your poise. Overstatement is 1 of the common faults. A single overstatement, wherever or however it occurs, diminishes the whole, \& a single carefree superlative has the power to destroy, for readers, the object of your enthusiasm.'' -- \cite[p. 84]{Strunk_White2019}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\subsection{Avoid the use of qualifiers.}
``\textit{Rather, very, little, pretty} -- these are the leeches that infest the pond of prose, sucking the blood of words. The constant use of the adjective \textit{little} (except to indicate size) is particularly debilitating; we should all try to do a little better, we should all be very watchful of this rule, for it is a rather important one, \& we are pretty sure to violate it now \& then.'' -- \cite[p. 85]{Strunk_White2019}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\subsection{Do not affect a breezy manner.}
``The volume of writing is enormous, these days, \& much of it has a sort of windiness about it, almost as though the author were in a state of euphoria. ``Spontaneous me,'' say Whitman, \&, in his innocence, let loose the hordes of uninspired scribblers who would 1 day confuse spontaneity with genius.

The breezy style is often the work of an egocentric, the person who imagines that everything that comes to mind is of general interest \& that uninhibited prose creates high spirits \& carries the day. Open any alumni magazine, turn to the class notes, \& you are quite likely to encounter old Spontaneous Me at work -- an aging collegian who writes something like this:
\begin{quotation}\it
	Well, guys, here I am again dishing the dirt about your disorderly classmates, after passing a week in the Big Apple trying to catch the Columbia hoops tilt \& then a cab-ride from hell through the West Side casbah. \& speaking of news, howzabout tossing a few primo items this way?
\end{quotation}
This is an extreme example, but the same wind blows, at lesser velocities, across vast expanses of journalistic prose. The author in this case has managed in 2 sentences to commit most of the unpardonable sins: he obviously has nothing to say, he is showing off \& directing the attention of the reader to himself, he is using slang with neither provocation nor ingenuity, he adopts a patronizing air by throwing in the word \textit{primo}, he is humorless (though full of fun), dull, \& empty. He has not done his work. Compare his opening remarks with the following -- a plunge directly into the news:
\begin{quotation}\it
	Clyde Crawford, who stroked the varsity shell in 1958, is swinging an oar again after a lapse of 40 years. Clyde resigned last spring as executive sales manager of the Indiana Flotex Company \& is now a gondolier in Venice.
\end{quotation}
This, although conventional, is compact, informative, unpretentious. The writer has dug up an item of news \& presented it in a straightforward manner. What the 1st writer tried to accomplish by cutting rhetorical capers \& by breeziness, the 2nd writer managed to achieve by good reporting, by keeping a tight rein on his material, \& by staying out of the act.'' -- \cite[p. 87]{Strunk_White2019}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\subsection{Use orthodox spelling.}
``In ordinary composition, use orthodox spelling. Do not write \textit{nite} for \textit{night, thru} for \textit{through, pleez} for \textit{please}, unless you plan to introduce a complete system of simplified spelling \& are prepared to take the consequences.

In the original edition of \textit{The Elements of Style}, there was a chapter on spelling. In it, the author had this to say:
\begin{quotation}\it
	The spelling of English words is not fixed \& invariable, nor does it depend on any other authority than general agreement. At the present day there is practically unanimous agreement as to the spelling of most words $\ldots$ At any given moment, however, a relatively small number of words may be spelled in more than 1 way. Gradually, as a rule, 1 of these forms comes to be generally preferred, \& the less customary form comes to look obsolete \& is discarded. From time to time new forms, mostly simplifications, are introduced by innovators, \& either win their place or die of neglect.
	
	The practical objection to unaccepted \& oversimplified spellings is the disfavor with which they are received by the reader. They distract his attention \& exhaust his patience. He reads the form though automatically, without thought of its needless complexity; he reads the abbreviation tho \& mentally supplies the missing letters, at the cost of a fraction of his attention. The writer has defeated his own purposed.
\end{quotation}
The language manages somehow to keep pace with events. A word that has taken hold in our century is \textit{thru-way}; it was born of necessity \& is apparently here to stay. In combination with \textit{way, thru} is more serviceable than \textit{through}; it is a high-speed word for readers who are going 65. \textit{Throughway} would be too long to fit on a road sign, too slow to serve the speeding eye. It is conceivable that because of our thruways, \textit{through} will eventually become \textit{thru} -- after many more thousands of miles of travel.'' -- \cite[p. 88]{Strunk_White2019}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\subsection{Do not explain too much.}
``It is seldom advisable to tell all. Be sparing, e.g., in the use of adverbs after ``he said,'' ``she replied,'' \& the like: ``he said consolingly''; ``she replied grumblingly.'' Let the conversation itself disclose the speaker's manner of condition. Dialogue heavily weighted with adverbs after the attributive verb is cluttery \& annoying. Inexperienced writers not only overwork their adverbs but load their attributives with explanatory verbs: ``he consoled,'' ``she congratulated.'' They do this, apparently, in the belief that the word \textit{said} is always in need of support, or because they have been told to do it by experts in the art of bad writing.'' -- \cite[p. 89]{Strunk_White2019}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\subsection{Do not construct awkward adverbs.}
``Adverbs are easy to build. Take an adjective or a participle, add \textit{-ly}, \& behold! you have an adverb. But you'd probably be better off without it. Do not write \textit{tangledly}. The word itself is a tangle. Do not even write \textit{tiredly}. Nobody says \textit{tangledly} \& not many people say \textit{tiredly}. Words that are not used orally are seldom the ones to put on paper.
\begin{example}
	He climbed tiredly to bed. $\to$ He climbed wearily to bed.
	
	The lamp cord lay tangledly beneath her chair. $\to$ The lamp cord lay in tangles beneath her chair.
\end{example}
Do not dress words up by adding \textit{-ly} to them, as though putting a hat on a horse.
\begin{example}
	overly $\to$ over, muchly $\to$ much, thusly $\to$ thus.'' -- \cite[p. 90]{Strunk_White2019}
\end{example}


%------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\subsection{Make sure the reader knows who is speaking.}
``Dialogue is a total loss unless you indicate who the speaker is. In long dialogue passages containing no attributives, the reader may become lost \& be compelled to go back \& reread in order to puzzle the thing out. Obscurity is an imposition on the reader, to say nothing of its damage to the work.

In dialogue, make sure that your attributives do not awkwardly interrupt a spoken sentence. Place them where the break would come naturally in speech -- i.e., where the speaker would pause for emphasis, or take a breath. The best test for locating an attributive is to speak the sentence aloud.
\begin{example}
	``Now, my boy, we shall see,'' he said, ``how well you have learned your lesson.'' $\to$ ``Now, my boy,'' he said, ``we shall see how well you have learned your lesson.''
	
	``What's more, they would never,'' she added, ``consent to the plan.'' $\to$  ``What's more,'' she added, ``they would never consent to the plan.'''' -- \cite[p. 91]{Strunk_White2019}
\end{example}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\subsection{Avoid fancy words.}
``Avoid the elaborate, the pretentious, the coy, \& the cute. Do not be tempted by a 20-dollar word when there is a 10-center handy, ready \& able. Anglo-Saxon is a livelier tongue than Latin, so use Anglo-Saxon words. In this, as in so many matters pertaining to style, one's ear must be one's guide: \textit{gut} is a lustier noun than \textit{intestine}, but the 2 words are not interchangeable, because \textit{gut} is often inappropriate, being too coarse for the context. Never call a stomach a tummy without good reason.

If you admire fancy words, if every sky is \textit{beauteous}, every blonde \textit{curvaceous}, every intelligent child prodigious, if you are tickled by \textit{discombobulate}, you will have a bad time with Reminder 14. What is wrong, you ask, with \textit{beauteous?} No one knows, for sure. There is nothing wrong, really, with any word -- all are good, but some are better than others. A matter of ear, a matter of reading the books that sharpen the ear.

The line between the fancy \& the plain, between the atrocious \& the felicitous, is sometimes alarmingly fine. The opening phrase of the Gettysburg address is close to the line, at least by our standards today, \& Mr. Lincoln, knowingly or unknowingly, was flirting with disaster when he wrote ``4 score \& 7 years ago.'' The President could have got into his sentence with plain ``87'' -- a saving of 2 words \& less of a strain on the listeners' powers of multiplication. But Lincoln's ear must have told him to go ahead with 4 score \& 7. By doing so, he achieved cadence while skirting the edge of fanciness. Suppose he had blundered over the line \& written, ``In the year of our Lord seventeen hundred \& seventy-six.'' His speech would have sustained a heavy blow. Or suppose he had settle for ``87.'' In that case he would have got into his introductory sentence too quickly; the timing would have been bad.

The question of ear is vital. Only the writer whose ear is reliable is in a position to use bad grammar deliberately; this writer knows for sure when a colloquialism is better than formal phrasing \& is able to sustain the work at a level of good taste. So cock your ear. Years ago, students were warned not to end a sentence with a preposition; time, of course, has softened that rigid decree. Not only is the preposition acceptable at the end, sometimes it is more effective in that spot than anywhere else. ``A claw hammer, not an ax, was the tool he murdered her with.'' This is preferable to ``A claw hammer, not an ax, was the tool with which he murdered her.'' Why? Because it sounds more violent, more like murder. A matter of ear.

\& would you write ``The worst tennis player around here is I'' or ``The The worst tennis player around here is me''? The 1st is good grammar, the 2nd is good judgment -- although the \textit{me} might not do in all contexts.

The split infinitive is another trick of rhetoric in which the ear must be quicker than the handbook. Some infinitives seem to improve on being split, just as a stick of round stovewood does. ``I cannot bring myself to really like the fellow.'' The sentence is relaxed, the meaning is clear, the violation is harmless \& scarcely perceptible. Put the other way, the sentence becomes stiff, needlessly formal. A matter of ear.

There are times when the ear not only guides us through difficult situations but also saves us from minor or major embarrassments of prose. The ear, e.g., must decide when to omit \textit{that} from a sentence, when to retain it. ``She knew she could do it'' is preferable to ``She knew that she could do it'' -- simpler \& just as clear. Bu tin many cases the \textit{that} is needed. ``He felt that his big nose, which was sunburned, made him look ridiculous.'' Omit the \textit{that} \& you have ``He felt his big nose $\ldots$'''' -- \cite[p. 93]{Strunk_White2019}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\subsection{Do not use dialect unless your ear is good.}
``Do not attempt to use dialect unless you are a devoted student of the tongue you hope to reproduce. If you use dialect, be consistent. The reader will become impatient or confused upon finding 2 or more versions of the same word or expression. In dialect it is necessary to spell phonetically, or at least ingeniously, to capture unusual inflections. Take, e.g., the word \textit{once}. It often appears in dialect writing as \textit{oncet}, but \textit{oncet} looks as though it should be pronounced ``onset.'' A better spelling would be \textit{wunst}. But if you write it \textit{oncet} once, write it that way throughout. The best dialect writers, by \& large, are economical of their talents; they use the minimum, not the maximum, of deviation from the norm, thus sparing their readers as well as convincing them.'' -- \cite[p. 94]{Strunk_White2019}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\subsection{Be clear.}
``Clarity is not the prize in writing, nor it is always the principal mark of a good style. There are occasions when obscurity serves a literary yearning, if not a literary purpose, \& there are writers whose mien is more overcast than clear. But since writing is communication, clarity can only be a virtue. \& although there is no substitute for merit in writing, clarity comes closest to being one. Even to a writer who is being intentionally obscure or wild of tongue we can say, ``be obscure clearly! Be wild of tongue in a way we can understand!'' Even to writers of market letters, telling us (but not telling us) which securities are promising, we can say, ``Be cagey plainly! Be elliptical in a straightforward fashion!''

Clarity, clarity, clarity. When you become hopelessly mired in a sentence, it is best to start fresh; do not try to fight your way through against the terrible odds of syntax. Usually what is wrong is that the construction has become too involved at some point; the sentence needs to be broken apart \& replaced by 2 or more shorter sentences.

Muddiness is not merely a disturber of prose, it is also destroyer of life, of hope: death on the highway caused by a badly worded road sign, heartbreak among lovers caused by a misplaced phrase in a well-intentioned letter, anguish of a traveler expecting to be met at a railroad station \& not being met because of a slipshod telegram. Think of the tragedies that are rooted in ambiguity, \& be clear! When you say something, make sure you have said it. The chances of your having said it are only fair.'' -- \cite[p. 95]{Strunk_White2019}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\subsection{Do not inject opinion.}
``Unless there is a good reason for its being there, do not inject opinion into a piece of writing. We all have opinions about almost everything, \& the temptation to toss them in is great. To air one's views gratuitously, however, is to imply that the demand for them is brisk, which may not be the case, \& which, in any event, may not be relevant to the discussion. Opinions scattered indiscriminately about leave the mark of egotism on a work. Similarly, to air one's views at an improper time may be in bad taste. If you have received a letter inviting you to speak at the dedication of a new cat hospital, \& you have cats, your reply, declining the invitation, does not necessarily have to cover the full range of your emotions. You must make it clear that you will not attend, but you do not have to let fly at cats. The writer of the letter asked a civil question; attack cats, then, only if you can do so with good humor, good taste, \& in such a way that your answer will be courteous as well as responsive. Since you are out of sympathy with cats, you may quite properly give this as a reason for not appearing at the dedicatory ceremonies of a cat hospital. But bear in mind that your opinion of cats was not sought, only your services as a speaker. Try to keep things straight.'' -- \cite[p. 96]{Strunk_White2019}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\subsection{Use figures of speech sparingly.}
``The simile is a common device \& a useful one, but similes coming in rapid fire, one right on top of another, are more distracting than illuminating. Readers need time to catch their breath; they can't be expected to compare everything with something else, \& no relief in sight.

When you use metaphor, do not mix it up. I.e., don't start by calling something a swordfish \& end by calling it an hourglass.'' -- \cite[p. 97]{Strunk_White2019}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\subsection{Do not take shortcuts at the cost of clarity.}
``Do not use initials for the names of organizations or movements unless you are certain the initials will be readily understood. Write things out. Not everyone knows that MADD means Mothers Against Drunk Driving, \& even if everyone did, there are babies being born every minute who will someday encounter the name for the 1st time. They deserve to see the words, not simply the initials. A good rule is to start your article by writing out names in full, \& then, later, when your readers have got their bearings, to shorten them.

Many shortcuts are self-defeating; they waste the reader's time instead of conserving it. There are all sorts of rhetorical stratagems \& devices that attract writers who hope to be pithy, but most of them are simply bothersome. The longest way round is usually the shortest home, \& the one truly reliable shortcut in writing is to choose words that are strong \& surefooted to carry readers on their way.'' -- \cite[p. 98]{Strunk_White2019}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\subsection{Avoid foreign languages.}
``The writer will occasionally find it convenient or necessary to borrow from other languages. Some writers, however, from sheer exuberance or a desire to show off, sprinkle their work liberally with foreign expressions, with no regard for the reader's comfort. It is a bad habit. Write in English.'' -- \cite[p. 99]{Strunk_White2019}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\subsection{Prefer the standard to the offbeat.}
