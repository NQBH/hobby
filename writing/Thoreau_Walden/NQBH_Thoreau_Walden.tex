\section{Quotes}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item ``I learned this, at least, by my experiment: that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, \& endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.''
	\item ``Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth.''
	\item ``I find it wholesome to be alone the greater part of the time. To be in company, even with the best, is soon wearisome \& dissipating. I love to be alone. I never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude.''
	\item ``If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them.''
	\item ``Books are the treasured wealth of the world \& the fit inheritance of generations \& nations.''
	\item ``We need the tonic of wildness $\ldots$ At the same time that we are earnest to explore \& learn all things, we require that all things by mysterious \& unexplorable, that land \& sea be indefinitely wild, unsurveyed \& unfathomed by us because unfathomable. We can never have enough of nature.''
	\item ``Live in each season as it passes; breathe the air, drink the drink, taste the fruit, \& resign yourself to the influence of the earth.''
\end{enumerate}
