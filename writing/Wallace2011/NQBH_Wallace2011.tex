\section{Quotes}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item ``Everybody is identical in their secret unspoken belief that way deep down they are different from everyone else.''
	\item ``I do things like get in a taxi \& say, ``The library, \& step on it.''''
	\item ``The truth will set you free. But not until it is finished with you.''
	\item ``You will become way less concerned with what other people think of you when you realize how seldom they do.''
	\item ``Mario, what do you get when you cross an insomniac, \& unwilling agnostic \& a dyslexic?''
	
	``I give.''
	
	``You get someone who stays up all night torturing himself mentally over the question of whether or not there's a dog.''
	\item ``It's weird to feel like you miss someone you're not even sure you know.''
	\item ``Try to learn to let what is unfair teach you.''
	\item ``What passes for hip cynical transcendence of sentiment is really some kind of fear of being really human, since to be really human [$\ldots$] is probably to be unavoidably sentimental \& naive \& goo-prone \& generally pathetic.''
	\item ``It did what all ads are supposed to do: create an anxiety relievable by purchase.''
	\item ``That sometimes human beings have to just sit in 1 place \&, like, hurt. That you will become way less concerned with what other people think of you when you realize how seldom they do. That there is such a thing as raw, unalloyed, agendaless kindness. That it is possible to fall asleep during an anxiety attack. That concentrating on anything is very hard work.''
	\item ``[$\ldots$] almost nothing important that ever happens to you happens because you engineer it. Destiny has no beeper; destiny always leans trenchcoated out of an alley with some sort of `psst' that you usually can't even hear because you're in such a rush to or from something important you've tried to engineer.''
	\item ``$\ldots$ logical validity is not a guarantee of truth.';
	\item ``Te Occidere Possunt Sed Te Edere Non Possunt Nefas Est'' (``They can kill you, but the legalities of eating you are quite a bit dicier'').''
	\item ``I think there must be probably different types of suicides. I'm not one of the self-hating ones. The type of like ``I'm shit \& the world'd be better off without poor me'' type that says that but also imagines what everybody'll say at their funeral. I've met types like that on wards. Poor-me-I-hate-me-punish-me-come-to-my-funeral. Then they show you a $20\times25$ glossy of their dead cat. It's all self-pity bullshit. It's bullshit. I didn't have any special grudges. I didn't fail an exam or get dumped by anybody. All these types. Hurt themselves. I didn't want to especially hurt myself. Or like punish. I don't hate myself. I just wanted out. I didn't want to play anymore is all. I wanted to just stop being conscious. I'm a whole different type. I wanted to stop feeling this way. If I could have just put myself in a really long coma I would have done that. Or given myself shock I would have done that. Instead.''
	\item ``\& lo, for the Earth was empty of Form, \& avoid. \& Darkness was all over the Face of the Deep. \& We said: `Look at that fucker Dance.''
	\item ``You can be shaped, or you can be broken. There is not much in between. Try to learn. Be coachable. Try to learn from everybody, especially those who fail. This is hard. $\ldots$ How promising you are as a Student of the Game is a function of what you can pay attention to without running away.''
	\item ``I'll say god seems to have a kind of laid-back management style I'm not crazy about. I'm pretty much anti-death. God looks by all accounts to be pro-death. I'm not seeing how we can get together on this issue, he \& I $\ldots$''
	\item ``sarcasm \& jokes were often the bottle in which clinical depressives sent out their most plangent screams for someone to care \& help them.''
	\item ``$\ldots$ That no single, individual moment is in \& of itself unendurable.''
	\item ``$\ldots$ most Substance-addicted people are also addicted to thinking, meaning they have a compulsive \& unhealthy relationship with their own thinking.''
