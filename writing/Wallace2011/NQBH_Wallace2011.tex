\section{Quotes}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item ``Everybody is identical in their secret unspoken belief that way deep down they are different from everyone else.''
	\item ``I do things like get in a taxi \& say, ``The library, \& step on it.''''
	\item ``The truth will set you free. But not until it is finished with you.''
	\item ``You will become way less concerned with what other people think of you when you realize how seldom they do.''
	\item ``Mario, what do you get when you cross an insomniac, \& unwilling agnostic \& a dyslexic?''
	
	``I give.''
	
	``You get someone who stays up all night torturing himself mentally over the question of whether or not there's a dog.''
	\item ``It's weird to feel like you miss someone you're not even sure you know.''
	\item ``Try to learn to let what is unfair teach you.''
	\item ``What passes for hip cynical transcendence of sentiment is really some kind of fear of being really human, since to be really human [$\ldots$] is probably to be unavoidably sentimental \& naive \& goo-prone \& generally pathetic.''
	\item ``It did what all ads are supposed to do: create an anxiety relievable by purchase.''
\end{enumerate}
